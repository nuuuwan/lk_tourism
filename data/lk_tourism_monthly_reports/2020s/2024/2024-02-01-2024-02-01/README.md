Summary

In February 2024, Sri Lanka witnessed a substantial upsurge in international tourist arrivals, marking an impressive 102.09% increase from the previous year, totaling 218,350 visitors. This surge was attributed to sustained peak tourism season momentum and favorable local and international conditions, contributing significantly to the overall rejuvenation of the tourism sector.

Throughout February, Sri Lanka experienced a notable surge in visitors from pivotal source markets, including Russia, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China. These nations played a pivotal role in propelling the surge in tourist arrivals, thereby providing additional support to Sri Lanka's tourism industry.

According to the most recent projections by PATA, international visitor arrivals (IVA) are expected to

see substantial growth in 2024, surpassing the volume recorded in 2019. Furthermore, the forecasts suggest that this trend of annual increases will persist into both 2025 and 2026.

As per the UNWTO, despite the pandemic challenges, international tourism has rebounded to 88% of pre-pandemic levels, driven by strong pent-up demand. Forecasts indicate a complete recovery by 2024, with a projected 2% growth surpassing 2019 levels. Industry optimism is high, with 67% of professionals expressing positivity for 2024 compared to the preceding year, according to the latest UNWTO Tourism Confidence Index survey. The anticipated recovery by the end of 2024 is credited to the release of pent-up demand, improved air connectivity, and the robust resurgence of Asian markets and destinations
