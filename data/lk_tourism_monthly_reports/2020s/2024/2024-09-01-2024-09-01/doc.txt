Summary

In September, Sri Lanka recorded 122,140 tourist arrivals, a 25.8% drop from August but a 9.1% increase compared to September 2023. This month marked the slowest growth rate of 2024. By the end of September, total arrivals reached 1,484,808, reflecting a steady recovery in the tourism sector. The decline from August can be attributed to seasonal factors, as travel typically decreases in September with the conclusion of summer vacations in major source markets. Additionally, the visa issuance crisis may have further impacted the arrival numbers, leading to lower-than-expected figures.

However, the 9.1% year-on-year increase compared to September 2023 highlights a positive recovery trend. This improvement may reflect Sri Lanka's ongoing efforts to boost tourism following challenges posed by the

pandemic and other economic difficulties in previous years.

In September, Sri Lanka's primary source markets were India, China, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia with notable increases in visitors from these countries driving the growth of the tourism sector.

The latest UNWTO Barometer presents a mostly optimistic outlook for international tourism between May and September 2024, with a strong recovery expected. However, several factors are constraining this rebound, including economic issues like inflation and high fuel prices, geopolitical instability, travel restrictions and visa requirements, low consumer confidence, and lingering concerns about COVID-19. These challenges continue to impact the speed of tourism’s recovery

In September, India led as the top source of tourists to Sri Lanka, accounting for 22.8% of total arrivals, followed by China at 7.4%, the United Kingdom at 7.1%, Germany at 6.8%, and Australia at 5.9%. These numbers highlight changing travel preferences. There was a notable increase in visitors from emerging markets such as the Maldives, Bangladesh, and Spain compared to the previous year, showing a growing interest in Sri Lanka.

Sustainable tourism to regenerative tourism

For centuries, people have traveled for trade, exploration, and leisure. In recent decades, however, tourism has emerged as a dominant global economic sector, contributing significantly to many national economies. This growth has not come without costs tourism has led to environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, and negative social impacts, including over tourism and the erosion of local cultures. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified these vulnerabilities, offering a critical moment to reconsider how tourism could evolve. While sustainable travel has become a common practice in the hospitality and tourism sectors, regenerative travel is rapidly gaining traction as both travelers and businesses recognize the importance of going beyond mere sustainability. This approach also appeals to travelers looking for deeper, more authentic experiences, particularly in remote and less-visited destinations (Forbes, n.d).

The Rise of Regenerative Tourism

The concept of sustainable tourism has long focused on minimizing the negative impacts of travel—aiming for eco-friendly practices like reducing carbon footprints and conserving water. However, regenerative tourism takes this a step further by actively improving the environments and communities affected by tourism. Rather than just "sustaining," regenerative tourism seeks to leave destinations better than they were before (Forbes, n.d).

Regenerative tourism emphasizes the renewal of ecosystems, support for local economies, and the fostering of cultural exchanges that strengthen mutual understanding. It is particularly attractive to travelers seeking deeper, more authentic experiences in remote, lesser-known destinations. Regenerative tourism’s core idea can be summed up as “the act of something growing or being grown again,” with a goal to ensure that tourism acts as a positive force in restoring natural and social environments.

A Framework for Regenerative Travel

Global initiatives have been introduced to guide this shift, the most notable being the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism. Launched at COP 26 in 2021, this declaration outlines a global plan to halve tourism-related emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It calls on signatories to focus on five key areas: measuring impact, decarbonizing operations, regenerating environment s, collaborating across sectors, and securing the necessary financing to ensure long-term change [UNWTO].

Examples of Regenerative Tourism in Action

Countries like New Zealand have adopted regenerative principles through the Tiaki Promise. This initiative invites tourists to protect the land, culture, and environment of New Zealand, ensuring that their visits leave no harm behind.

The Philippines presents a remarkable example of regenerative tourism through its efforts on Boracay Island. To restore and preserve its natural beauty, the government temporarily closed the island for six months, focusing on environmental rehabilitation. This initiative transformed Boracay into a cleaner, more sustainable destination for both locals and tourists. As part of the process, visitors are invited to take the “Oath for a Better Boracay,” pledging to help maintain the island's rejuvenated state, ensuring it remains an enjoyable place to live and visit. (WTTC Travel Hub))

How Sri Lanka can adopt regenerative tourism

Sri Lanka, renowned for its rich biodiversity, cultural heritage, and stunning landscapes, stands in an ideal position to embrace regenerative tourism. This approach would not only protect its natural and cultural assets but also allow them to thrive and improve.

Restoration of Key Natural Sites

Restoring Ecosystems: Like the Philippines' Boracay Island rehabilitation, Sri Lanka could focus on regenerating its heavily visited areas, such as Sigiriya and Yala National Park. Limiting access during off-seasons could allow time for nature to heal while educating tourists on conservation efforts.

Reforestation Programs: Partnering with local communities and international organizations, Sri Lanka can initiate reforestation projects in its forests and coastal areas, restoring ecosystems while engaging visitors in active regeneration efforts.

Cultural Preservation and Community Engagement

Supporting Local Economies: Emphasizing locally owned businesses and traditional crafts, Sri Lanka can empower communities by providing them direct benefits from tourism. Tourists can be encouraged to stay in eco-friendly, community-run accommodations.

Cultural Immersion: Incorporating local culture through initiatives like homestays and community-based tourism will strengthen cultural heritage. Sri Lanka could encourage tourists to partake in traditional activities, contributing to the preservation of cultural practices.

Adopting the Tiaki Promise Model

Sri Lanka could introduce a similar initiative to New Zealand's Tiaki Promise, where tourists commit to respecting and protecting the environment and culture. Visitors could take a pledge, promising to leave the destination in a better state than they found it.

Decarbonizing Tourism Operations

Sustainable Transportation: Sri Lanka can adopt low-carbon transport solutions for tourists, such as electric buses in national parks and urban centers. Incentivizing eco-friendly transport and minimizing air travel within the island can significantly reduce tourism’s carbon footprint.

Renewable Energy in Tourism: Tourism-related businesses can invest in renewable energy sources such as solar panels, reducing their reliance on fossil fuels and moving toward carbon neutrality.

Collaboration with Global Initiatives

By aligning with global initiatives like the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism, Sri Lanka can set clear targets to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This will position the country as a leader in regenerative travel, drawing eco-conscious travelers.

Promotion of Lesser-Known Destinations

To combat over tourism, Sri Lanka can focus on promoting lesser-known regions like the Knuckles Mountain Range or the Eastern Coast. This not only spreads the economic benefits of tourism but also relieves pressure on overburdened destinations, allowing for their regeneration.

Public and Private Sector Partnerships

Sri Lanka should encourage collaboration between government, businesses, and NGOs to develop regenerative tourism projects. This could include launching pilot programs that demonstrate the viability of regenerative tourism in specific regions, creating a blueprint for the rest of the country.

Visitor Education and Participation

Creating platforms that educate visitors on regenerative practices and involve them in local conservation activities, like beach cleanups or wildlife monitoring, would deepen their engagement and contribute to the well-being of the environment.

Conclusion

Regenerative tourism represents an evolution in the way we think about travel and its impacts. Unlike sustainable tourism, which focuses on reducing harm, regenerative tourism seeks to improve the places travelers visit, actively restoring ecosystems, enhancing local economies, and nurturing cultural heritage. As global tourism recovers from the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift toward regenerative practices offers a vital opportunity to address environmental degradation and social inequities while fostering authentic, meaningful travel experiences. Embracing regenerative tourism not only preserves these locations for future generations but also ensures that tourism becomes a positive, restorative force for our planet and its people.
