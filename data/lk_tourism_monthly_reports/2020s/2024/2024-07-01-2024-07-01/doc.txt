Summary

In July, Sri Lanka recorded 187,810 tourist arrivals, reflecting a significant 65.5% increase compared to June and a 31.3% growth compared to July 2023. The total number of arrivals by the end of July reached 1,198,059.

In July, Sri Lanka's primary source markets were India, the United Kingdom, China, the Netherlands, and Germany, with notable increases in visitors from these countries driving the growth of the tourism sector.

The latest UNWTO Barometer indicates a generally positive outlook for international tourism from May to August 2024, with strong recovery expected. However, the recovery remains constrained by various factors, including ongoing economic challenges like inflation and high fuel costs, as well as geopolitical uncertainties. Moreover, travel restrictions, including visa requirements, low consumer confidence, and lingering COVID-19 concerns, continue to impact the pace of recovery.

Top ten source markets

July 2024

In July, India emerged as the top source of tourists to Sri Lanka, making up 21.9% of total arrivals while United Kingdom Contributed 11.1% . China and the Netherlands followed with 6.9% and 6.1%, respectively, while Germany accounted for 5.7%. These figures highlight shifting travel preferences. Notably, there was a significant rise in arrivals from India and the Netherlands compared to the previous year, indicating a move towards emerging destinations. The decline in Canadian tourist arrivals might be linked to fewer visits for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives. The emergence of markets like the Netherlands and Switzerland, along with the absence of Russia in the top markets, is particularly noteworthy.

The synergy of better air connectivity, advantageous local conditions, close geographical proximity and geopolitical factors has markedly increased the role of these countries as key contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism industry.

The significant number of tourists categorized as "other" or “not responded” is a result of the lack of classification for the purpose of visit in the recently introduced visa categories. This also include tourists who had visited for other purposes also.

Trends and Opportunities in the Russian Tourism Market

Russian outbound travel

Russian outbound travel has seen a notable increase, with an 8.8% rise in the first quarter of 2024, resulting in 5.3 million trips made by Russians for tourism and other purposes during this period (Asia 2024) Over the first three quarters of 2023, the total number of outbound trips from Russia reached 21,020,012, marking a 12.4% increase compared to the same period in 2022 (russtd.com, n.d.). The Russian outbound travel market, recognized as the ninth largest in the world in terms of expenditure, contributes significantly to global tourism with $22.3 billion spent abroad annually (Statistica).

Russian Tourist Arrivals to Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka has recently celebrated a significant milestone in its tourism sector by reaching 118,682 Russian tourist arrivals by 31st July 2024. The Russian tourist arrivals for the consecutive years of 2021, 2022, and 2023 were 16,894, 91,272, and 197,498 respectively. This achievement was made possible through direct flights operated by Aeroflot, Azur Air, and Redwings, which together brought a considerable number of Russian visitors. This influx of Russian tourists represents a crucial boost for Sri Lanka's economy, especially in the wake of the economic challenges the country has faced in recent years. However, As depicted in the below charts, the arrivals are gradually declining from the month of May 2024.

Measures to incentivize the Russian Tourists

Facilitating Charter operations from Russia

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the embarkation tax at Mattala International Airport was initially lifted. This tax was lifted again in December 2022. Landing and parking fees are waived for scheduled flights at Mattala International Airport for two years from the start. However, charter flights do not receive this benefit, and Red Wings Airlines did not qualify for this exemption as it operated charter flights. Thus, a policy decision either to extend this facility to charter flights as well or to lift the Embarkation Levy could incentivize the tourists from Russia.

Visa

Currently, Sri Lanka offers a free visa facility for tourists from Russia. This initiative has the potential to be a significant incentive for increasing tourist arrivals from Russia. Extending this free visa facility could further boost tourism in several ways:

 Increase Tourist Arrivals: Offering free visas makes Sri Lanka a more attractive destination, potentially increasing tourist arrivals.  Encourage Repeat Visits: Simplifying the visa process encourages tourists to consider Sri Lanka for repeat visits, fostering long-term tourism growth.  Enhance Tourist Experience: A hassle-free visa process improves the overall travel experience, making Sri Lanka more competitive compared to other destinations.

13

Extending the free visa facility for Russian tourists can thus play a crucial role in revitalizing and sustaining Sri Lanka’s tourism sector.

Acceptance of native currencies for transaction in trade and tourism

Russians face challenges transacting in leading currencies, such as the dollar and euro, due to economic sanctions and banking restrictions. To mitigate these issues, it is essential to create opportunities for Russians to transact in their own currency. By allowing transactions in rubles, their spending power can significantly increase, boosting their confidence and ability to spend more freely during their travels.

An agreement between countries to accept each other's currencies can be mutually beneficial, fostering stronger economic ties and simplifying financial transactions for tourists. Facilitating transactions in their native currency could lead to an increase in daily expenditure, as tourists will feel more comfortable and secure in their financial dealings. Moreover, improving the accessibility and modes of transaction will not only enhance the overall travel experience but also potentially double the number of tourist arrivals, as the ease of spending in familiar currency attracts more visitors. Ensuring that financial infrastructure supports these transactions is crucial for realizing these benefits and maximizing the economic impact of tourism.

Way forward

To significantly increase the number of Russian tourists visiting Sri Lanka, it's essential to implement measures that reduce the financial burden of travel. One such measure is the exemption of embarkation fees and landing and parking costs for flights, landing especially at Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, which has proven effective in the past. These financial incentives can make Sri Lanka a more attractive destination for airlines and tourists alike.

Extending the visa waiver for a longer period could serve as an additional incentive to facilitate hassle-free travel for Russian tourists. Continuing the waiver would help maximize the benefits from the influx of Russian tourists.

Additionally, accepting native currencies for transactions in trade and tourism would attract more Russian tourists who face restrictions when using their own currencies.
