Summary

Tourist arrivals for June were recorded at 113,470, marking a 13% increase compared to June 2023. Despite this growth, the numbers remain below June 2018's figure of 146,828 and the conservative forecast of 148,695. The total arrivals up to June reached 1,010,249.

Key source markets for Sri Lanka in June included India, the United Kingdom, China, Australia, and the Maldives. These countries showed significant increases in visitor numbers, contributing to the growth of the tourism sector.

According to the latest UNWTO Barometer, an estimated 285 million tourists traveled internationally

in the first three months of 2024, marking an increase of about 20% compared to the same period in 2023. International arrivals reached 97% of 2019 levels in the first quarter of 2024, indicating a near-complete recovery to pre-pandemic figures. The positive results were driven by sustained high demand, improved air connectivity, and facilitated visa processes, as highlighted in the latest Tourism Visa Openness report. However, several factors continue to weigh on the recovery of international tourism. These include persistent economic challenges, such as inflation and high fuel prices, as well as geopolitical uncertainties (UNWTO, 2024).

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report June 2024

Top ten source markets

June 2024

In June, India emerged as the top source of tourists to Sri Lanka, comprising 25.2% of total arrivals. The United Kingdom and China followed with 8.2% and 7.6%, respectively, while Australia contributed 5.6%. These figures indicate shifting travel preferences. Notably, there were significant increases in visitors from Bangladesh and China compared to the previous year, indicating a trend toward emerging destinations. Conversely, declines in tourists from Russia, Canada, and Germany compared to last June may be attributed to seasonal travel changes or preferences for alternative destinations. Additionally, the reduction in Canadian arrivals could be linked to fewer visits for the purpose of seeing friends and relatives.

The enhanced significance of these countries as key contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism sector can be attributed to the combined impact of improved air connectivity, favorable local conditions, geographical proximity, and geopolitical factors.

Tourist arrivals by purpose of visit

June 2024

An in-depth analysis of tourist motivations for choosing Sri Lanka as their destination reveals several key reasons. According to the available data, leisure and vacation account for the majority of visits, representing 3% of the total, highlighting the country's strong appeal as a leisure destination. Additionally, 1% of visitors travel to reunite with friends and family, showcasing Sri Lanka's ability to attract individuals seeking personal connections. Conversely, only 0.08% of visits are for business purposes, indicating a minimal focus on professional activities. Furthermore, 0.12% of travelers attend MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) events, underscoring Sri Lanka's growing reputation as a destination for corporate events. In June, the primary reason for travelers from major source markets to visit Sri Lanka was for leisure and vacation. A significant number of tourists from all key markets, except Canada, came for leisure, underscoring Sri Lanka's reputation as a destination for relaxation and enjoyment. The interest in visiting friends and relatives in Sri Lanka decreased in June, with only 3% of Canadian travelers opting to connect with friends and family during their trips.

The significant number of tourists categorized as "other" or “not responded” is a result of the lack of classification for the purpose of visit in the recently introduced visa categories. This also include tourists who had visited for other purposes also.

Tourism tale: Sri Lanka’s path to a million tourists

In 2024, Sri Lanka is on track to meet an ambitious target of attracting 2.3 million tourists, marking significant growth from the 1,487,303 tourists it welcomed in 2023. By June 2024, the country had already received 1,010,249 tourists, indicating a strong upward trend in tourism. However, these numbers are still lower than the 1,164,647 tourists recorded in the same period in 2018. Monthly forecasts for 2024 show a positive trend, but actual tourist arrivals consistently fall short of these optimistic projections. When compared to 2018 figures, the number of tourists from January to June 2024 has decreased, indicating that Sri Lanka has not yet fully returned to pre-COVID levels.

January 2024 experienced the most substantial year-on-year increase compared to 2023, showing a remarkable rise of 103.08%. Conversely, June 2024 recorded the sharpest decline in arrivals when compared to the same month in 2018, also marking the lowest growth rate compared to 2023.

Comparing arrivals for the first six months of 2024, there has been a 61.6% increase compared to 2023. However, when compared to 2018, there is a noticeable decline of 13.25%. These figures underscore the imperative to attract more tourists. Even under an optimistic scenario, the current arrivals still lag behind by 169,208.

Total Arrivals 1,164,647 624,874 1,010,249 -13.25 61.6 1,179,457

In conclusion, while Sri Lanka's tourism sector in 2024 shows promising signs of recovery and growth compared to the previous year, it has not fully rebounded to pre-pandemic levels seen in 2018. The substantial year-on-year increase in January 2024 highlights potential for recovery, but the sharp decline observed in May 2024 indicates ongoing challenges. Monthly forecasts suggest optimism, yet actual arrivals often fall short, emphasizing the need for targeted strategies to meet the ambitious target of 2.3 million tourists for the year. Addressing these challenges effectively will be crucial for sustaining and accelerating tourism growth in Sri Lanka.
