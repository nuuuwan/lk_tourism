Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report December 2024

Summary

Sri Lanka managed to close off 2024 with a positive look towards the future of it's tourism industry as in December, 248,592 tourists were welcomed, which is a 35% increase compared to November as well as a 18.18% boost compared to December of 2023. By the end of the month, total arrivals reached 2,053,465 which is an indication of the fact that the industry is recovering steadily. Such growth is indicative of the ongoing tourism strategies and position Sri Lanka well to market it as a tourism hub.

In December, Sri Lanka's primary tourism markets included India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. The

significant increase in tourist arrivals from these countries has been a key driver of growth in the sector.

According to the UNWTO, an estimated 1.1 billion international tourist arrivals (overnight visitors) were recorded from January to September 2024, representing an 11% increase compared to the same period in 2023. International arrivals reached 98% of 2019 levels during these nine months. While international tourist arrivals are anticipated to match 2019 figures by the end of 2024, this recovery occurs within a challenging economic and geopolitical landscape.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

December 2024

Map 1. Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe has emerged as a dominant player in Sri Lanka's tourism sector, accounting for 51.9% of total visitors, while Asia and the Pacific closely follow with 41% of arrivals. This trend highlights the evolving dynamics within the industry, with both regions significantly contributing to growth. The increasing demand from key markets such as India, the Russian Federation, the UK, Germany, and France has greatly supported Sri Lanka's tourism, bolstered by strong travel connections and favourable conditions. In contrast, the Americas represent 5.1% of arrivals, while the Middle East and Africa contribute 1.1% and 1%, respectively, adding to the diversity of the tourism landscape.

The significant influx of visitors from Europe and the Asia-Pacific region underscores their steady demand, while the comparatively smaller contributions from the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa present valuable opportunities for targeted marketing and diversification. Enhancing connections with these regions could further strengthen Sri Lanka's tourism industry, enhancing its resilience and supporting ongoing recovery and growth.

Top ten source markets

January to December 2024

From January to December this year, Sri Lanka experienced a notable increase in tourist arrivals from India, the Russian Federation, the UK, Germany, and China, solidifying these nations as the top five international visitor markets. Additionally, there was significant growth in visitor numbers from the Netherlands and France, reflecting Sri Lanka's rising popularity in these regions. This combination of growth and decline represents the importance for Sri Lanka to diversify its tourism markets, which in turn can bolster resilience whilst also creating a sustainable tourism approach in a changing travel climate. By widening its scope to more emerging and diverse markets, Sri Lanka can better weather regional disruptions and build a stronger platform for sustained tourism sector growth.

Tourism recovery in 2024

World tourism recovery

The year 2024 marked a significant milestone in the global tourism industry's recovery from the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) projected that international tourism would fully recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2024, with initial estimates indicating a 2% growth above 2019 figures. This positive trajectory was supported by increased traveler confidence and the lifting of travel restrictions in various regions. The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) anticipated a record-breaking year for the sector, with the global economic contribution expected to reach an all-time high of $11.1 trillion.

International tourism demonstrated a robust recovery in the first nine months of 2024 with an estimated 1.1 billion overnight visitors globally—an 11% increase compared to the same period in 2023. This surge brought international arrivals to 98% of 2019 levels, indicating a near-complete rebound to pre-pandemic figures. The Middle East emerged as the fastest-growing region, recording a 29% increase in international arrivals compared to 2019. This growth is attributed to factors such as visa facilitation, investment in major tourism projects, enhanced air capacity, strong marketing, hosting of events, and product diversification. Africa experienced a 6% rise in tourist arrivals over the same period in 2019. Notably, North Africa led this growth with an 18% increase in international arrivals, driven by destinations like Morocco and Egypt. Europe's international arrivals exceeded pre-pandemic numbers by 1%, indicating a full recovery. The region benefited from robust intra-regional demand, with countries such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain contributing significantly to this growth. The Americas reached 97% of their 2019 international arrival levels, reflecting a near-complete rebound. Central America stood out with a 16% increase in arrivals compared to pre-pandemic figures, highlighting the region's growing appeal to international tourists. Asia and the Pacific achieved 85% of their 2019 arrival numbers, indicating a steady recovery. The gradual easing of travel restrictions and the reopening of key markets have contributed to this upward trend.

Tourism recovery in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka's tourism industry has demonstrated a steady recovery and resilience throughout 2024, rebounding from recent challenges to reestablish itself as a premier travel destination. Sri Lanka surpassed 2 million tourist arrivals, marking the fourth instance of reaching this milestone, following similar achievements in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Notably, 2024 set a new record with the highest number of annual tourist arrivals since 2018. In December alone, the country welcomed 248,592with projections suggesting the figure would reach the conservative scenario of 236,485 by the month's end.

Tourist Arrivals Performance by Month 2018- 2024

An analysis of monthly growth rates indicates that February achieved a 102.8% increase compared to January's 103%, marking them as the months with the highest growth rates of the year. March, April, May, and July also experienced moderate growth, while September recorded the lowest growth rates. Overall, the year saw a 38.01% growth compared to 2023; however, there was a 12% decline when compared to 2018.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report December 2024

11

In 2024, Sri Lanka set ambitious targets for tourist arrivals, aiming for 2,180,000 visitors in the conservative scenario and 2,363,475 in the optimistic scenario. However, the actual arrivals fell short, with a deficit of 126,535 compared to the conservative target and 310,010 below the optimistic projection. This shortfall can be attributed to several challenges that impacted the tourism sector throughout the year.

Challenges affecting tourism growth

Introduction of the New Visa System: The implementation of a new visa system may have caused confusion and delays, potentially deterring potential visitors.

Elections and Political Instability: The political climate, including elections and associated uncertainties, might have influenced travelers' decisions, leading to a decline in tourist arrivals during certain periods.

Travel Warnings and Safety Concerns: Travel advisories and warnings, such as those issued regarding potential terrorist threats targeting popular tourist locations, could have deterred tourists from visiting Sri Lanka.

Delays in Infrastructure Development: Ongoing infrastructure projects and delays in development may have affected the quality of services and facilities available to tourists, impacting their overall experience and potentially reducing the number of visitors.

Geopolitical Factors: Regional geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainties might have influenced travelers' choices, leading them to opt for alternative destinations perceived as more stable or cost-effective.

Competition from Other Destinations: The introduction of visa-free access by competitor destinations and other marketing strategies could have attracted potential tourists away from Sri Lanka, further contributing to the shortfall in arrivals.

Despite these challenges, Sri Lanka's tourism sector demonstrated resilience. Looking ahead, addressing these challenges and capitalizing on the sector's strengths will be crucial for achieving and surpassing future tourism targets.
