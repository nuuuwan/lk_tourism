Summary

In August, Sri Lanka welcomed 164,609 tourists, reflecting a 12.3% decline compared to July but showing a 20.7% increase compared to August 2023. The total tourist arrivals by the end of August reached 1,362,688, highlighting a steady recovery in the tourism sector. The month-over-month decline could be attributed to seasonal fluctuations, as August often sees reduced travel due to the end of summer vacations in key source markets. However, the year-on-year growth of 20.7% indicates a positive trend, driven by ongoing efforts to attract more visitors compared to the previous year, when numbers were likely impacted by lingering effects of the pandemic or economic challenges. Despite the monthly variations, the cumulative total emphasizes the resilience and gradual recovery of Sri Lanka's tourism industry, although factors like seasonality

and economic conditions in source countries may continue to influence arrival numbers.

In August, Sri Lanka's primary source markets were India, the United Kingdom, China, Germany, and Italy with notable increases in visitors from these countries driving the growth of the tourism sector.

The latest UNWTO Barometer reflects a generally positive outlook for international tourism from May to August 2024, with strong recovery anticipated. However, this recovery is limited by factors such as economic challenges like inflation and high fuel costs, geopolitical uncertainties, travel restrictions, visa requirements, low consumer confidence, and ongoing COVID-19 concerns, all of which continue to affect the pace of tourism's rebound.

Map 1. Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe remains a dominant force in Sri Lanka's tourism, contributing 49.2% of total arrivals, while Asia and the Pacific are becoming increasingly influential, accounting for 43.7% of visitors. This shift highlights changing dynamics, with both regions playing crucial roles in shaping the industry. Growth is largely driven by rising demand from key markets such as India, the UK, Germany, and Italy, which have significantly bolstered Sri Lanka’s tourism sector through strong travel connections and favorable conditions. The Americas account for 4.7% of arrivals, and the Middle East and Africa contribute 1.7% and 0.7%, respectively, adding to the diverse profile of Sri Lanka’s tourist landscape. The strong European presence reflects established demand, while the growing influence of Asia and the Pacific underscores the appeal of regional travel. The relatively smaller shares from the Americas, Middle East, and Africa suggest further opportunities for targeted strategies to diversify and strengthen the market reach, enhancing the industry's overall recovery and growth.

Top ten source markets

August 2024

In August, India emerged as the top source of tourists to Sri Lanka, contributing 20.07% of total arrivals, followed by the United Kingdom at 10.68%, China at 6.8%, and Germany at 6.45%. These figures reflect shifting travel preferences among tourists. Notably, there was a significant rise in arrivals from Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands compared to the previous year, indicating a growing interest in Sri Lanka from these emerging markets.

The rise of markets like Italy and the Netherlands highlights shifting dynamics in tourist source countries, offering new opportunities for Sri Lanka’s tourism sector to diversify its visitor base. This diversification helps reduce dependency on traditional markets and enhances the industry’s resilience against fluctuations in specific regions.

January to August 2024

From January to August this year, Sri Lanka experienced a significant increase in tourist arrivals from India, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation, Germany, and China, positioning these countries as the top five international sources of visitors. Notably, there was a substantial rise in arrivals from China and the Netherlands during this period, reflecting the growing appeal of Sri Lanka among these markets. However, arrivals from the Russian Federation and Canada saw a decline compared to other leading countries, which could be attributed to changes in travel behavior among these tourists.

Generational Dynamics of Tourist Arrivals to Sri Lanka, January to June 2024

Tourism is a vital component of Sri Lanka’s economy, contributing significantly to national income, employment, and foreign exchange earnings. The country's rich cultural heritage, natural beauty, and diverse wildlife attract millions of tourists annually. Thus, understanding the generational differences among tourists is crucial for tailoring tourism services, marketing strategies, and policy development to meet their distinct needs. These generational shifts influence the types of tourism experiences sought, spending behaviors, and expectations of service quality, which in turn impact the growth and sustainability of Sri Lanka's tourism industry.

Generational characteristics of different segments

Baby Boomers

Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, are mostly retired and focus on traveling to fulfill their bucket list. They are significant spenders in the travel industry, with annual expenditures of around $157 billion (Ng, 2018). This generation prefers familiar travel experiences and revisiting favorite destinations. While they primarily book holidays online, they are less likely to use smartphones for this purpose and favour personal interaction, often choosing travel advisors over AI-driven solutions. Despite the growing trend of using cards, many Baby Boomers still prefer cash while traveling, particularly in the UK. Their preference for cash is rooted in habit and comfort, necessitating travel money providers to accommodate these traditional preferences (www.mintel.com, n.d.).

Generation X

Generation X, often balancing work and family responsibilities, has limited flexibility for travel and tends to prefer shorter trips to nearby destinations. They are generally more budget-conscious than other generations, seeking experiences that offer good value for money.

Having grown up alongside rapid technological advancements, Gen X is tech-savvy and stays current with new technologies. Unlike Baby Boomers, they tend to independently research and book their travel, relying less on travel agents and tour operators. Instead, they frequently use online travel agencies (OTAs) and review platforms like TripAdvisor for planning their trips (Acorn Tourism, 2024).

Millennials

This travel group, aged 28 to 43 as of May 2024, represents a significant portion of tourism spending, prioritizing experiences over material goods. Comprising young professionals and new parents, this diverse generation is sustainability-focused and seeks unique, off-the-beaten-path destinations for authentic experiences, avoiding overly touristy spots and staged attractions.

As the first generation to grow up with the internet, they are highly tech-savvy, with access to smartphones and computers. Four in ten UK millennials who follow or frequently view social media personalities view travel content, suggesting that travel brands should consider partnering with travel influencers to reach this demographic (www.mintel.com, n.d.). About 75% conduct online research before booking holidays, using social media for inspiration and seeking genuine, authentic content. They prefer businesses with user-friendly websites and often rely on OTAs and tour operators to make travel arrangements (Acorn Tourism, 2024).

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report August 2024

11

Generation z

Gen Z, aged 12 to 27 as of May 2024, is the most travel-focused generation, spending about 50% of their disposable income on travel. This group, which includes gap year travelers, university students, and young professionals, has relatively lower budgets and actively seeks good deals. They prioritize sustainability and authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences. Highly tech-savvy, they rely on social media for travel inspiration, valuing recommendations from influencers and peers. They prefer booking travel components separately through online travel agencies (OTAs) and favour businesses with straightforward booking processes and a strong online presence

An analysis of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka by generation shows that Millennials are the most frequent visitors, followed by Generation X and Baby Boomers.

They rely on friends and relatives for information and often engage in post-trip activities like writing blogs and posting reviews online. Millennials also prefer using online payment methods. The average duration of stay of this age cohort is 8.6 nights.

Baby Boomers visiting Sri Lanka usually travel with their spouse and plan their trips about three months in advance through travel agents, relying mainly on recommendations from friends and relatives. The average duration of stay recorded for them in Sri Lanka is 8.5 nights. In contrast, Generation X travelers either visit alone or with their spouse, make travel arrangements 1-3 months ahead, favor camping as accommodation, and typically use online payment methods. In terms of duration generation x travelers have recorded the lowest with 8.1 nights. This generational analysis highlights differing travel behaviors and preferences among tourists to Sri Lanka.

Current Implications for Sri Lanka Tourism

✓ Millennials as Key Market Segment: With Millennials being the largest group of tourists, their travel

habits—such as short lead times, reliance on digital information sources, and preference for online payments—highlight the need for Sri Lanka’s tourism industry to focus on digital marketing, social media engagement, and seamless online booking experiences. The average stay of 8.6 nights indicates their potential to contribute significantly to local spending. ✓ Targeted Services for Baby Boomers: Baby Boomers, who tend to plan their trips well in advance

and prefer traditional travel agents, require targeted travel packages that emphasize comfort, relaxation, and curated experiences. The 8.5 nights stay suggests a steady demand for longer, slower-paced tourism experiences, benefiting the accommodation sector. ✓ Adapting to Generation X Preferences: Generation X’s inclination toward camping and shorter

stays (8.1 nights) suggests a need for more outdoor and adventure tourism offerings. Enhancing eco-friendly and experiential tourism can attract this segment and add value to Sri Lanka's diverse travel landscape.

Future Implications of Generational Trends for Sri Lanka Tourism

✓ Growing Influence of Digital Natives: As Generation Z and Generation Alpha become more

dominant, the tourism sector in Sri Lanka will need to prioritize digital engagement strategies. Generation Alpha (born from 2010 onwards) is projected to become the largest generation by 2035. These generations are tech-savvy, prefer digital booking platforms, and are influenced by social media and peer reviews. Investments in robust digital marketing, user-friendly websites, and online payment options will be essential to attract these travelers. ✓ Emphasis on Experience-Based Travel: Both Millennials and Generation Z are drawn to unique,

authentic, and experiential travel. Sri Lanka can capitalize on this by promoting immersive experiences such as cultural exchanges, eco-tourism, and adventure activities. Tailoring experiences to these generations will be key in differentiating Sri Lanka as a preferred travel destination. ✓ Demand for Sustainable Tourism: Younger generations are increasingly environmentally conscious,

pushing for sustainable and ethical tourism practices. Sri Lanka will need to focus on developing eco-friendly tourism initiatives, promoting conservation efforts, and offering sustainable accommodation options to appeal to this growing demand.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report August - 2024

13

✓ Shift in Travel Planning and Decision-Making: With the decline in traditional travel planning methods

among younger generations, there will be a diminished role for travel agents. Sri Lanka’s tourism sector should adapt by creating direct-to-consumer marketing strategies and leveraging influencers, online communities, and travel apps. ✓ Shorter Booking Windows and Flexible Travel Options: Millennials and Generation Z favour

spontaneous and flexible travel plans. The tourism industry in Sri Lanka will need to accommodate these preferences by offering flexible booking policies, last-minute deals, and tailored packages that cater to short-notice travelers. ✓ Increased Use of Technology and Personalization: As Generation Alpha grows, the use of technology

in travel will expand, including AI-driven personalization and virtual reality experiences for travel planning. Sri Lanka should explore integrating advanced technologies into the travel experience to meet the expectations of this tech-savvy cohort.

Looking ahead, the influence of digital natives like Generation Z and Generation Alpha will reshape the market, necessitating innovative transformations. By embracing these trends, Sri Lanka can not only cater to the evolving demands of current tourists but also position itself as a forward-thinking, sustainable destination. This approach will ensure the country's tourism sector remains vibrant and resilient, attracting a diverse range of travelers from all generations and contributing significantly to the local economy.
