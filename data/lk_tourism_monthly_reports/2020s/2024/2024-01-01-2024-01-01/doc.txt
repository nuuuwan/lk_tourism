Summary

Sri Lanka experienced a notable surge in international tourist arrivals in January 2024, with a remarkable increase of 103.08% compared to the previous year January, totaling 208,253 visitors. This surge was attributed to the continuation of the peak tourism season and favorable local and international conditions, contributing to the overall revitalization of the tourism sector.

During the month of January, Sri Lanka saw a significant rise in visitors from key source markets such as India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China. These countries played a crucial role in driving the increase in tourist arrivals, further bolstering Sri Lanka's tourism industry.

According to the UNWTO World Tourism Barometer, global international tourist arrivals reached an estimated 1,286 million in 2023, marking a 34% increase from 2022. With strong pent-up demand, international tourism has rebounded to 88% of pre-pandemic levels, and it is anticipated to fully recover by 2024, with a projected 2% growth above 2019 levels. Positive sentiments are reflected in the latest UNWTO Tourism Confidence Index survey, with 67% of industry professionals expressing optimism for 2024 compared to 2023. The expected full recovery by the end of 2024 is attributed to the release of pent-up demand, improved air connectivity, and the stronger rebound of Asian markets and destinations.
