Summary

In October, Sri Lanka recorded 135,907 tourist arrivals, showing an 11.3% rise from September and a notable 24.5% increase compared to October 2023. This brought the cumulative total to 1,620,715 arrivals by the end of October, underscoring a steady recovery in tourism. Although October’s conservative target was set at 143,032, the near-achievement highlights strong demand and a positive trajectory in the sector's growth this year.

In October, Sri Lanka's key tourism markets included India, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China, with significant growth in visitors from these countries fueling the sector's expansion.

The latest UNWTO Barometer offers a largely optimistic forecast for international tourism from May to October 2024, with robust recovery anticipated. However, the rebound faces challenges from various factors, including economic pressures like inflation and high fuel costs, geopolitical instability, travel restrictions, visa requirements, low consumer confidence, and ongoing COVID-19 concerns. These hurdles continue to influence the pace of tourism’s recovery.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

October 2024

Map 1. Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Asia and the Pacific have emerged as key players in Sri Lanka’s tourism sector, contributing 50.4% of total visitors, while Europe follows closely with 43.1% of arrivals. This trend highlights the shifting dynamics within the industry, with both regions serving as significant drivers of growth. Increased demand from major markets like India, the Russian Federation, the UK, Germany, and China has substantially bolstered Sri Lanka’s tourism, supported by strong travel connections and favorable conditions. Meanwhile, the Americas make up 4.5% of arrivals, with the Middle East and Africa contributing 1.3% and 0.8%, respectively, adding diversity to the tourism landscape.

The substantial presence of European and Asia-Pacific visitors reflects their steady demand, while the smaller shares from the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa present strategic opportunities for targeted marketing and diversification. Expanding engagement with these regions could help Sri Lanka further strengthen the tourism sector, enhancing resilience and driving continued recovery and growth.

Top ten source markets

October 2024

In October, India ranked as the top source market for tourists to Sri Lanka, contributing 26.8% of total arrivals. This was followed by the Russian Federation with 7.6%, the United Kingdom at 7.5%, Germany at 6.8%, and China at 6.1%. These figures underscore evolving travel preferences and reveal a notable increase in visitors from emerging markets like Bangladesh, along with renewed interest from established markets such as France compared to the previous year. The rising significance of markets like France points to shifting trends in Sri Lanka's tourist sources, creating valuable opportunities to expand and diversify the visitor base. The decline in visitors from Russia is noteworthy, though the introduction of charter flights in November is expected to stimulate recovery in that market, strengthening Sri Lanka's appeal and accessibility.

Top ten source markets

January to October 2024

From January to October this year, Sri Lanka experienced a marked increase in tourist arrivals from India, the UK, the Russian Federation, Germany, and China, establishing these countries as the top five international visitor sources. Visitor numbers from China, the Netherlands, and France also showed significant growth, underscoring Sri Lanka’s expanding appeal in these markets. However, a decline in arrivals from Russia stands out, signaling a shift in the country’s visitor demographics. This combination of growth and decline highlights the importance for Sri Lanka to diversify its tourism markets, enhancing resilience and ensuring sustainable growth amid an evolving global travel landscape. By broadening its reach to include emerging and diverse markets, Sri Lanka can better weather fluctuations in specific regions and build a stronger foundation for continued success in the tourism sector.

The significant number of tourists categorized as "other" or “not responded” is a result of the lack of classification for the purpose of visit in the recently introduced visa categories. This also include tourists who had visited for other purposes also.
