Summary

In November, Sri Lanka welcomed 184,158 tourists, marking a 35.5% increase from October and a significant 21.6% rise compared to November 2023. By the end of the month, the total number of arrivals reached 1,804,873, reflecting a consistent recovery in the tourism sector. Despite a conservative target of 182,693 for November, the actual figures exceeded expectations, showcasing robust demand and a positive trend in the sector’s growth this year.

In November, Sri Lanka's main tourism markets were India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China, with notable

growth in tourist arrivals from these countries driving the sector's growth.

According to the latest UNWTO Barometer, international tourist arrivals (overnight visitors) reached approximately 790 million in the first seven months of 2024, marking an 11% increase from 2023, though still 4% below 2019 levels. Geopolitical uncertainties, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict, and other rising tensions, continue to pose significant risks for the global tourism sector. However, the UN Tourism Confidence Index indicates optimistic expectations for the remainder of the year.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

November 2024

Map 1. Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe has become a dominant force in Sri Lanka’s tourism industry, accounting for 52.7% of total visitors, while Asia and the Pacific follow closely with 40.9% of arrivals. This shift underscores the changing dynamics within the sector, with both regions playing key roles in driving growth. The rise in demand from key markets such as the Russian Federation, the UK, Germany, and France has significantly supported Sri Lanka’s tourism, aided by strong travel connections and favorable conditions. In contrast, the Americas represent 4.4% of arrivals, while the Middle East and Africa contribute 1.4% and 0.6%, respectively, enriching the diversity of the tourism landscape.

The strong presence of visitors from Europe and Asia-Pacific highlights their consistent demand, whereas the relatively smaller contributions from the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa offer valuable opportunities for focused marketing and diversification. Strengthening connections with these regions could further bolster Sri Lanka's tourism industry, improving its resilience and supporting ongoing recovery and growth.

Top ten source markets

January to November 2024

From January to November this year, Sri Lanka saw a significant rise in tourist arrivals from India, the Russian Federation, the UK, China, and Germany, solidifying these countries as the top five international visitor markets. Additionally, visitor numbers from the Netherlands and France showed notable growth, highlighting Sri Lanka's growing popularity in these regions. However, a decline in arrivals from Russia signals a notable shift in the country’s visitor demographics. This mix of growth and decline underscores the need for Sri Lanka to diversify its tourism markets, strengthening resilience and promoting sustainable growth in a shifting global travel environment. Expanding its reach to include emerging and varied markets will enable Sri Lanka to better navigate regional fluctuations and establish a more robust foundation for long-term success in the tourism industry.

Catalysts of Change: The Transformative Impact of the Sri Lanka Tourism Awards 2024

The Sri Lanka Tourism Awards 2024, set for December, is a key event in the nation's tourism calendar. It aims to honour achievements across multiple categories, promoting innovation, sustainability, and excellence in service within the tourism industry. Lessons from other countries illustrate the powerful role tourism awards play in enhancing regional tourism, supporting sustainability, and safeguarding cultural heritage. For example, Spain's "Tourism Excellence Awards" have boosted local traditions and gastronomy, drawing niche markets. New Zealand's eco-focused tourism awards have integrated sustainable practices within the sector, aligning growth with environmental goals. Thailand's "Amazing Thailand Tourism Awards" have helped solidify the country’s position as a global tourism leader, spotlighting unique cultural and luxury travel experiences. In Australia, the recognition of Indigenous tourism initiatives has promoted cultural preservation and provided economic benefits to Indigenous communities. Launched in 2008, the Sri Lanka Tourism Awards have the potential to fulfill several key roles.

Raising Industry Standards:

Recognizing accomplishments in accommodation, tourist restaurants, and specified tourist services motivates service providers to enhance the quality of their offerings. This ripple effect improves the overall visitor experience, making Sri Lanka a more competitive global destination.

Promoting Sustainability:

The inclusion of awards for sustainable practices highlights the importance of balancing tourism growth with environmental stewardship. Initiatives like reducing carbon footprints, preserving biodiversity, and promoting eco-tourism become focal points for stakeholders aiming for recognition.

Encouraging Economic Synergies:

Categories such as MICE, airlines' contributions, and cruise line operators emphasize collaboration across industries. By recognizing the interdependence of sectors, the awards drive collective efforts that stimulate economic growth through improved connectivity and services.

Nurturing Talent and Education:

Honouring efforts in tourism education and training ensures that the next generation of industry professionals are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to adapt to evolving market demands.

Fostering Excellence in Service:

The award for excellence in service recognizes the front-line professionals whose dedication and expertise directly impact visitor satisfaction, ensuring that Sri Lanka continues to uphold its reputation for warm hospitality.

By acknowledging achievements across these categories, the awards serve as both a benchmark and an inspiration for stakeholders to innovate, collaborate, and achieve excellence. This event not only celebrates current successes but also sets the stage for sustained growth and global recognition of Sri Lanka as a leading travel destination.
