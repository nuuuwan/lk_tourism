Summary

In March 2024, Sri Lanka saw a significant rise in international tourist arrivals, marking a 66.6% increase compared to March of the previous year, with a total of 209,181 visitors. However, when compared to the 233,382 arrivals recorded in 2018 and the forecasted conservative estimate of 218,002, the March 2024 arrivals still fall short. The total arrivals recorded until March amounted to 635,784.

In March, Sri Lanka experienced a notable surge in tourist arrivals from vital source markets including India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China. The substantial increase in visitors from

these countries significantly contributed to boosting Sri Lanka's tourism sector.

By 2024, it is expected that international tourist arrivals will completely rebound, surpassing 2019 levels with a projected growth of 2%. The recent UNWTO Tourism Confidence Index survey indicates positive sentiment, with 67% of industry professionals showing optimism for 2024 compared to the previous year. The anticipated full recovery by the end of 2024 is credited to the release of pent-up demand, enhancements in air connectivity, and the resurgence of Asian markets and destinations.

Top ten source markets

March 2024

In January, India led tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka, representing 15% of the total, with Russia, the UK, Germany, and China closely following at 14%, 10%, 9%, and 6% respectively. These figures underscore changing travel preferences. Significantly, there was a rise in arrivals from China, Poland, and the United Kingdom compared to the previous year, indicating a shift towards emerging destinations. Poland's notable inclusion in the top ten source markets is noteworthy. However, Canada experienced a decrease in tourist arrivals compared to the previous March, despite being in the top ten list. This decline might be attributed to the absence of the diaspora visiting friends and relatives during this period.

The combined influence of factors like the current peak season, enhanced air links, favorable local settings, geographical proximity, and geopolitical conditions has significantly boosted these nations' importance as major contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism industry.

Europe's Performance as a Primary Source Market

Sri Lanka's tourism industry is experiencing robust growth, marked by significant increases in tourist arrivals and earnings. In January, February and March 2024, the sector saw impressive growth rates of 103.08%, 102.09% and 66.6% in tourist arrivals compared to the same months in previous year. Ambitious targets have been set, with expectations of welcoming over 2.3 million tourists in 2024. The industry's resilience is evident as it reached 1,025.88 USD Mn in earnings in the first quarter of 2024, showcasing a remarkable revival despite challenges. With investmen ts in infrastructure and promotional activities, Sri Lanka aims to capitalize on its natural beauty, cultural heritage, and diverse attractions to position itself as a leading tourist destination in the region.

Europe stands as a crucial source market for Sri Lanka's tourism industry, with its contribution to tourist arrivals escalating from 48% in 2021 to 60% in 2022 before stabilizing at 50.9% in 2023. Various historical events and trends have shaped tourism flows to Sri Lanka. The Civil Conflict (1983-2009) notably deterred tourists due to safety concerns and negative media coverage, whereas the period of Post-War Recovery since 2009 witnessed a resurgence in travelers. Global events like economic recessions and geopolitical conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have also influenced tourism patterns. Additionally, the Easter attack and economic crises have negatively impacted tourist influx. Effective tourism promotion strategies, including targeted marketing campaigns, have played a pivotal role in attracting especially European visitors by showcasing Sri Lanka's cultural and natural attractions. Moreover, investments in infrastructure, particularly in transportation and accommodation facilities, have bolstered Sri Lanka's appeal as a tourist destination for Europeans, contributing to increased tourism flows. Considering the blend of positive and negative elements, it's worthwhile to explore their influence on tourist arrivals originating especially from Europe.

Europe stands out as the primary hub for outbound tourism, presenting an enticing market to focus on. According to data from the UNWTO in 2019, Europe witnessed a staggering 743.9 million international tourist arrivals, constituting slightly more than half, or 51%, of the total global outbound tourism, which amounted to 1.465 billion international arrivals. As of 2022, Europe's contribution to global outbound tourism had surged to 62%, with international arrivals reaching 595 million, equivalent to 80% of the 2019 volume. While this proportion might decline as tourism normalizes, it remains a reliable gauge of Europe's market robustness. Additionally, air passenger traffic data underscores Europe's pandemic recovery progress, with figures showing an impressive rebound to 86% of the 2019 level by Q3 2022 (www.cbi.eu, n.d.).

An examination of European inbound tourism to Sri Lanka until March 2024, compared to the same period in 2018 and 2023, reveals intriguing insights. In March 2018, arrivals from the main European regions declined, except for Central and Eastern Europe, which saw a growth rate of 101.75%. However, comparing arrivals up to March in 2023 and 2024 shows positive growth rates across all regions, with Northern Europe experiencing the highest growth at 111.04%. The presence of the United Kingdom in this region likely contributes significantly to this growth trend. Central and Eastern Europe exhibited the lowest growth rates at 55.9%, with the Russian Federation and Poland identified as the main contributors to this region's arrivals.

In 2024, Europe's outbound tourism is forecasted to stabilize to consistent growth levels after a period of slowdown. Projections suggest that Europe will witness stable growth levels in outbound travel, indicating a normalization of the tourism sector (Skift Research, n.d.). Optimistic projections from previous years estimated outbound tourism from Europe to reach approximately 86.9 million trips by 2024. (www.cbi.eu, n.d.). Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Europe is expected to resume its role as a significant contributor to global outbound tourism. This stabilization reflects the gradual recovery and normalization of travel patterns in the region, with travelers increasingly returning to international destinations (www.cbi.eu, n.d.).

Interest in traveling to the Asia-Pacific region among European travelers is rebounding, particularly in Western European markets. Euro monitor International reports that in 2023, 9.1 million trips were made from Eastern Europe to Asia-Pacific, representing 65% of pre-pandemic levels, while Western Europe contributed 18.7 million trips, reaching 71% of pre-pandemic levels. Top destinations for Eastern Europeans in 2023 included Thailand, China, Indonesia, India, and Vietnam, while Western Europeans favored Thailand, Pakistan, India, Japan, and China. Forward Keys also notes increasing European interest in the Asia-Pacific region, primarily driven by essential segments like VFR, expatriate, and business travel. The UK emerged as the most recovered European source market to Asia-Pacific in 2023.

Looking ahead to the first half of 2024, Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia, and France are driving the recover y, albeit at varying rates. Forward Keys, highlights differences in recovery speeds across European markets, citing Spain's rapid outbound recovery due to re-established air connectivity and aggressive marketing campaigns by some Asia-Pacific destinations to attract Spanish travelers (Yue, 2024).

European travelers are influenced by various factors when choosing their travel destinations. Safety and security are paramount, with travelers prioritizing destinations that offer a sense of protection. Affordability also plays a crucial role, as travelers consider budget-friendly options essential. Additionally, the allure of diverse attractions and activities caters to the interests and preferences of European travelers. Destinations boasting rich cultural and historical significance attract those seeking immersive experiences. Moreover, accessibility, including good transportation infrastructure, is vital, making it convenient for travelers to explore and navigate their chosen destinations. Furthermore, the appea l of natural beauty, including scenic landscapes and outdoor adventures, resonates with European travelers seeking to connect with nature and enjoy picturesque views. Collectively, these factors shape the preferences of European travelers when selecting th eir next travel destination (Travel Weekly, n.d).

In 2024, Europe's economic prospects will vary among its economies. Germany and Eastern European nations, closely linked to its industrial supply chain, are poised for gradual improvement. Although inflation remains above the long -term average, supply-side factors are expected to ease, bringing consumer price inflation below 3% in many significant European economies. This signals a move towards more stable economic conditions, with inflationary pressures gradually easing across the region (EIU, 2023). Consequently, an increase in travelers is anticipated for 2024, despite economic constraints experienced during last year. This scenario presents an opportunity for Sri Lanka to benefit from the uptick in travel demand.

Strategic initiatives offer promising opportunities for increased European tourism to Sri Lanka. Firstly, diversifying tourism offerings by promoting adventure, eco-tourism, cultural experiences and other niche segments can attract a wider range of European travelers seeking unique experiences. Secondly, targeted marketing strategies tailored to European preferences, including digital platforms and partnerships with travel agencies, can effectively boost visitor numbers by highlighting Sri Lanka's rich culture and authentic cuisine. Thirdly, enhancing transportation networks, accommodations, and sustainable tourism infrastructure is crucial to support the influx of European tourists and improve the overall visitor experience(BRISL, n.d.). By focusing on these areas, Sri Lanka can position itself as a top choice for European travelers beyond traditional destinations
