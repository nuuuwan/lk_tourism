Summary

In May, tourist arrivals declined to 112,128, marking the lowest number of visitors this year and representing a 24.6% drop compared to April. These numbers are still below April 2018's figure of 129,466 and the conservative forecast of 120,934. Total arrivals up to April reached 896,799.

Sri Lanka's key source markets in May included India, the United Kingdom, Maldives, China and Germany, with significant increases in visitors from these countries contributing to the growth of the tourism sector.

According to the latest UNWTO Barometer, the prospects for international tourism from May to August 2024 are generally positive, with a strong recovery anticipated. However, several factors continue to weigh on the recovery of international tourism. These include persistent economic challenges, such as inflation and high fuel prices, as well as geopolitical uncertainties. Additionally, the travel restrictions including visa requirements, low consumer confidence and COVID 19 related issues also play significant roles in influencing recovery trajectories.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report May 2024

Top ten source markets

May 2024

In May, India was the leading source of tourists to Sri Lanka, accounting for 28.8% of total arrivals. The UK and Maldives followed at 7.2% each, while China and Germany contributed 6.7% each. These figures reflect changing travel preferences. Notably, there was an increase in arrivals from the Maldives compared to the previous year, suggesting a shift towards emerging destinations. The decline in Russian tourist arrivals compared to May last year may be due to changes in their travel season or a preference for other destinations. Additionally, the decrease in Canadian tourist arrivals could be attributed to fewer visits for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives.

The combined influence of improved air connections, favorable local conditions, geographical proximity, and geopolitical circumstances has significantly enhanced the importance of these countries as major contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism sector.

Travel and Tourism Development Index and Sri Lanka

Introduced in 2022, the Travel & Tourism Development Index (TTDI) evaluates and benchmarks the factors and policies that promote the sustainable and resilient growth of the Travel & Tourism (T&T) sector, contributing to national development. Evolving from the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), which has been published biennially since 2007, the TTDI provides valuable insights for policy-makers, companies, and stakeholders. It highlights the strengths and areas for improvement in T&T economies by examining the interconnected internal and external factors that drive this multifaceted sector.

Additionally, the TTDI aims to offer context and promote multistake holder dialogue, helping stakeholders understand emerging trends and risks in global travel and tourism. This guidance supports policy formulation, operational practices, and investment strategies, ensuring the index remains relevant to the evolving global landscape. The index consists of five dimensions, 17 pillars, and 102 individual indicators, each allocated to different pillars.

Tourism in Sri Lanka has evolved significantly over the decades, becoming a vital component of the country's post-war economic development. After the civil war ended in 2009, Sri Lanka experienced unprecedented growth in tourist arrivals, with an impressive annual growth rate. This growth has been driven by the country's rich cultural heritage, diverse wildlife, and scenic landscapes, which include pristine beaches, wildlife parks, ancient ruins, and tea plantations. The tourism sector's development has been supported by government initiatives, including the establishment of a systematic and planned approach to tourism in 1966. Key attractions such as Yala National Park, Sigiriya Rock Fortress, and the central highlands' tea plantations highlight the country's natural and cultural diversity. These efforts have positioned tourism as a significant driver of employment and foreign exchange earnings in Sri Lanka

In the latest Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) report for 2024, Sri Lanka is ranked 76th. This ranking reflects the country's performance across various pillars such as business environment, safety and security, health and hygiene, human resources, and travel infrastructure. The TTDI measures the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable and resilient development of the Travel & Tourism sector, which are critical for the overall economic health and competitiveness of the tourism industry.

Comparison of ranks for Sri Lanka reveals that it has gradually come down in its position from 64th in 2017 to 77th in 2019, 74 in 2021 and 76 in 2024. This indicates a persistent challenge in improving the key determinants of tourism development, despite the country's rich natural and cultural resources.

When compared to other countries in the South Asian region, Sri Lanka's ranking indicates it is lagging behind several of its neighbors. Countries such as India (39th), Indonesia (22nd), Malaysia (35th), Thailand (47th) and Vietnam (59th) typically rank higher due to their more developed tourism infrastructure and stronger policy frameworks supporting tourism. They have scored in the areas such as Prioritization of travel and tourism, price competitiveness, ICT readiness, Natural, cultural and non-leisure resources and on-air transport and infrastructure. The regional results show that Europe and Asia-Pacific regions continue to outperform, highlighting the need for Sri Lanka to adopt more robust and effective tourism policies to climb the rankings.

Several factors contribute to Sri Lanka's current ranking, including infrastructure challenges, Cultural resources, and non-cultural resources issues. Addressing these areas through targeted policy measures and investments is crucial for improving the country's standing in future editions of the TTDI.

In the Travel and Tourism Index 2024, Sri Lanka exhibits strengths in safety and security (5.21), health and hygiene (4.66), ICT readiness (4.43), prioritization of travel and tourism (4.78), price competitiveness (5.69), and travel and tourism socio-economic impact (5.84). These metrics indicate the country's effective policies, and favorable conditions for tourists. Sri Lanka's high scores in safety, health, and ICT readiness signify a secure and well-prepared environment for travelers, while its prioritization of tourism highlights the government's commitment to the sector's development. Moreover, its competitive pricing and positive socio-economic impact further enhance its attractiveness to tourists. These strengths position Sri Lanka as an appealing destination for travelers seeking safety, affordability, and a positive socio-economic experience. Leveraging these strengths can help Sri Lanka sustain its growth momentum and enhance its standing in the global tourism landscape.

According to the Travel and Tourism Index, Sri Lanka faces challenges in areas like cultural resources (1.44), non-leisure resources (1.61), and tourist services and infrastructure (1.58). Therefore, it's essential for Sri Lanka to leverage its abundant cultural resources and enhance its tourist services and infrastructure. By doing so, the country can fully utilize these resources to drive the development of the tourism industry.

To elaborate, focusing on cultural assets such as historical sites, traditions, and local heritage can enrich tourists' experiences and attract more visitors. Additionally, improving tourist services like accommodation, transportation, and attractions can enhance satisfaction levels and encourage repeat visits. Investing in infrastructure development, including better roads, airports, and communication networks, can further support tourism growth by facilitating easier access to destinations and ensuring a smoother travel experience.

By addressing these areas of improvement, Sri Lanka can enhance its competitiveness in the global tourism market, attract more tourists, and ultimately foster sustainable growth and development in the tourism sector.

In summary, Sri Lanka's tourism has seen significant growth, fueled by its natural beauty, cultural wealth, and government backing. Despite challenges like cultural resources and tourist infrastructure, its strengths in safety, health, and ICT readiness offer a strong foundation for advancement. By maximizing strengths and tackling shortcomings, Sri Lanka can boost its global tourism appeal and cater to travelers seeking unique experiences. Through targeted investments and policies, the nation can ensure sustainable tourism growth, playing a pivotal role in its economic progress and prosperity. Leveraging strengths and addressing weaknesses will enhance Sri Lanka's tourism competitiveness and foster sustainable growth.
