Summary

In May 2023, Sri Lanka experienced a significant increase in international tourist arrivals compared to the same period in 2022. The number of foreign tourist arrivals rose by 175.8% year-on-year, reaching 83,309 visitors. This impressive growth brought the total number of tourists to 64% of pre-pandemic levels in 2018. However, compared to April 2023, there has been a decrease of 21% in tourist arrivals, indicating the end of the peak season in Sri Lanka.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

May 2023

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe accounted for the majority of

tourists visiting Sri Lanka, representing

39.3% of total arrivals. The increase in

tourism is believed to be a result of growing

demand from countries such as the

Russian Federation, United Kingdom and

Germany.

The Asia and Pacific region accounted for

49.5% of total tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka,

while the Americas and the Middle East

contributed 8.7% and 1.8% respectively.

The easing of travel restrictions and

enhanced air connectivity to Sri Lanka

could be the key drivers behind the growth

in tourism during this period.

According to UNWTO, international

tourism is expected to continue its recovery

throughout the year. Despite the positive

outlook for the recovery of international

tourism, its progress is being impeded

primarily by the difficult economic

circumstances.Factors such as high

inflation and rising oil prices have led to

increased costs for transportation and

accommodations. As a result, tourists are

anticipated to seek better value for their

money and opt for travel destinations

closer to home. These trends are driven by

the elevated prices and overall economic

difficulties.

Top ten source markets

May 2023

During May, the top source markets to Sri Lanka were India, the Russian Federation, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia. India accounted for the highest percentage of arrivals at 28%, while the Russian Federation, Germany, United Kingdom, and Australia represented 9%, 8%, 7%, and 5% respectively. These trends indicate changes in outbound travel preferences and travel patterns, with growth in arrivals from India and Russia signaling a shift towards emerging destinations.

The improved air accessibility, favorable conditions within the country, proximity, and geopolitical factors have contributed to making India and Russia the primary source of tourism for Sri Lanka.

It's worth noting that the global and local conditions have influenced the growth rates of arrivals from different countries. While countries like China, India, Germany, Australia, and the Russian Federation have shown substantial growth in arrivals, the United Kingdom and Canada have exhibited lowest growth rates compared to May 2022, possibly due to emerging trends and responses to global and local conditions.

The Role of Niche Tourism Products in Facilitating Sustainable Economic Recovery in Sri Lanka

Niche tourism is a rapidly growing segment within the tourism industry that initially targeted sophisticated travelers interested in pursuing a diverse range of activities. The concept of "niche tourism" draws inspiration from "niche marketing," which itself originated from the field of ecology (Stainton, 2020). Unlike mass tourism, niche tourism focuses on a smaller number of consumers but forms a consistent market within the tourism industry. Rather than emphasizing the quantity of visitors to a specific location at a given time, niche tourism is defined by the activities and interests of the tourists themselves.

In the context of Sri Lanka's tourism sector, the concept of niche tourism holds significant importance. Sri Lanka is a diverse and culturally rich country with a wide range of natural and cultural attractions. By developing and promoting niche tourism products, Sri Lanka can tap into specific markets and attract visitors seeking unique and authentic experiences. This approach allows the country to differentiate itself from mass tourism destinations and cater to the growing demand for more personalized and immersive travel experiences.

Niche tourism in Sri Lanka can take various forms, including but not limited to eco-tourism, cultural tourism, adventure tourism, wildlife tourism, wellness tourism, and gastronomic tourism. Each niche presents an opportunity to highlight Sri Lanka's distinct features, such as its stunning landscapes, ancient heritage sites, vibrant local communities, biodiversity, traditional arts, and culinary delights. By focusing on these niche segments, Sri Lanka can attract discerning travelers who are willing to pay more for authentic and sustainable experiences.

Developing niche tourism products in Sri Lanka also contributes to the overall sustainability of the tourism sector. Niche tourism tends to have a smaller environmental footprint compared to mass tourism, as it emphasizes responsible practices, community involvement, and conservation efforts. By promoting sustainable tourism practices within niche segments, Sri Lanka can protect its natural and cultural resources for future generations while reaping the economic benefits of tourism.

In this context, niche tourism can play a significant role in achieving sustainable economic recovery post-COVID-19. Niche tourism emphasizes specialized and authentic experiences, often with a focus on sustainability, local community engagement, and environmental conservation. By promoting niche tourism, destinations can diversify their tourism offerings and reduce their reliance on mass tourism, which can have negative impacts on the environment, culture, and local communities. By attracting niche tourists who have a genuine interest in sustainable and authentic experiences, destinations can generate higher-value tourism revenue, support local livelihoods, and contribute to the conservation of natural and cultural resources.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the tourism industry in Sri Lanka. Prior to the pandemic, tourism played a vital role in the country's economy, contributing to foreign exchange earnings, employment generation, and overall economic growth. However, the arrival of COVID-19 and the subsequent travel restrictions and lockdown measures resulted in a sharp decline in tourist arrivals and a significant reduction in tourism-related revenue.

Sri Lanka's tourism sector experienced a substantial decline in 2020. In 2018, tourism contributed 4.6% to the nation's GDP and earned $4.3 billion in earnings. However, in 2020, tourism's contribution to GDP plummeted to a mere 0.8%. The closure of borders and travel restrictions resulted in a drastic decrease in tourist arrivals and a decline in tourism-related activities.

As Sri Lanka navigates the path to recovery, the government and tourism authorities have been implementing measures to revive the tourism industry. The ongoing global situation, changes in travel patterns, and evolving consumer preferences pose challenges to the sector's recovery. According to the Global Niche Tourism Thematic Research Report 2022, the preferences of Gen Z and Millennials are playing a significant role in driving certain forms of niche tourism to new heights. The study reveals that a larger proportion of younger adults tend to book niche holiday types such as adventure, sport, and gastronomy . This indicates a shift in the tourism market, moving away from the traditional "sun and beach" vacations towards experiences that cater to the specific hobbies, interests, curiosities, and needs of holidaymakers. One of the key advantages of niche tourism is its ability to differentiate a destination from others and create a unique selling proposition. Sri Lanka, with its rich cultural heritage, natural beauty, and diverse offerings, has the potential to develop niche tourism products that cater to specific market segments. Targeting specific market segments through niche tourism allows Sri Lanka to create customized experiences that meet the unique needs and desires of these travelers. This can lead to increased visitor satisfaction, repeat visits, positive word-of-mouth recommendations, and ultimately, a loyal customer base. Niche tourism offers several advantages that contribute to higher visitor spending, reduced environmental impact, and cultural preservation. The key advantages of niche tourism include;  Higher Visitor Spending: Niche tourism attracts travelers who are often willing to spend more on

unique and tailored experiences. Their higher spending patterns can positively impact local businesses, accommodation providers, restaurants, and artisans, leading to increased revenue generation within the destination (Stainton, 2020).  Reduced Environmental Impact: Niche tourism promotes sustainable practices and reduces the

negative environmental impacts often associated with mass tourism (Bunghez, 2021).  Cultural Preservation: Niche tourism provides opportunities for the preservation and celebration of

local cultures, traditions, and heritage. Niche tourists are often interested in authentic and immersive experiences, seeking to connect with local communities and learn about their customs and ways of life (Bunghez, 2021).  Diversification of Tourism Offerings: Niche tourism allows destinations to diversify their tourism

products and experiences, catering to a broader range of visitor interests.  Enhanced Destination Competitiveness: Niche tourism can contribute to the overall

competitiveness of a destination (Stainton, 2020). Sri Lanka has significant potential for various niche tourism segments due to its rich natural landscapes, cultural heritage, and wellness traditions. Art, Culture and heritage, land and ocean adventures, nature and wildlife, wellness and healing, culinary tourism, agro tourism, festivals and events, volunteer tourism, weddings and celebrations, Digital nomads, MICE, and hosted experiences are some of the potential niche tourism segments that has been identified to be developed in Sri Lanka. Partnerships with local communities, entrepreneurs, and small-scale enterprises are instrumental in enhancing the authenticity and sustainability of niche tourism experiences. These collaborations contribute to the preservation of local culture, economic empowerment of communities, environmental stewardship, and the co-creation of unique tourism offerings. Niche tourism presents an opportunity especially for Sri Lanka to achieve a quicker recovery and reach the arrival targets by focusing on specific market segments with unique interests and preferences. By offering tailored experiences and leveraging the natural resources, Sri Lanka can attract niche travelers and differentiate in the market, contributing to the resilience and sustainability of the tourism sector.
