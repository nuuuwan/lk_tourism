Summary

In July 2023, Sri Lanka witnessed a remarkable surge in international tourist arrivals compared to the same period in 2022. The number of foreign tourist arrivals skyrocketed by 202.4% year-on-year, reaching a total of 143,039 visitors. This significant increase in tourist arrivals during July 2023 can be attributed to several factors, including the ongoing recovery of the tourism sector, pent-up demand, improved air connectivity, and the recent reopening of China as a key market. This positive trend is expected to persist throughout the year, according to the UNWTO.

When analyzing the data from January to July 2023, the cumulative figure of tourist arrivals reached 767,913, surpassing the numbers of the previous year, which

recorded 458,670 arrivals. This growth indicates a robust rebound in the tourism industry, as the numbers continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels.

The top five source markets for Sri Lanka's tourism in July 2023 were identified as India, the United Kingdom, China, Germany and Russia respectively. These countries played a crucial role in driving the surge in tourist arrivals, contributing to the overall recovery of Sri Lanka's tourism sector.

Furthermore, comparing June 2023 to July 2023, there was a significant increase of 42% in tourist arrivals. This growth further highlights the accelerated pace of recovery and the growing interest among international travelers to visit Sri Lanka..
