Summary

In October 2023, Sri Lanka experienced a notable increase in the quantity of international tourists arriving, as opposed to the corresponding period in 2022. The number of foreign tourists surged by an impressive 159.8% year-over-year, reaching a total of 109,199 visitors.

Nonetheless, in the month of October, a decline in arrivals was noted, amounting to a 2.4% decrease compared to September. This decline can likely be attributed to the gradual decrease in arrivals from key source markets such as India, China, Australia, and Israel.

Between January and October 2023, Sri Lanka achieved an impressive milestone in cumulative tourist arrivals, exceeding the previous year's figure of 568,258 by reaching a total of 1,125,455 visitors.

In September 2023, Sri Lanka's tourism sector saw a significant surge in visitors, with India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China emerging as the leading source markets. These countries played a crucial role in fueling the increase in tourist arrivals, making a substantial contribution to the overall revival of Sri Lanka's tourism industry

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

October 2023

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Sri Lanka witnessed a significant impact from

Asia and the Pacific, constituting a

substantial portion of tourists, making up

49.2% of the total arrivals. Simultaneously,

Europe assumed the lead as the primary

source market for tourists coming to Sri

Lanka, representing 43.7% of the overall

influx. This shift in the origins of tourists

highlights the evolving dynamics within Sri

Lanka's tourism industry, with Asia and the

Pacific playing a substantial role and Europe

emerging as a crucial source of tourists.

The increase in tourism can be attributed to

the growing demand from countries like

India, Russia, China, the United Kingdom,

and Germany, all of which have played a

substantial role in strengthening Sri Lanka's

tourism sector.

To explore these contributions further, the

Americas have constituted 4.8% of the

overall tourist arrivals, whereas the Middle

East has provided 1.5%. Each of these

regions has played unique and discernible

roles in shaping the characteristics of Sri

Lanka's tourism environment.

The outlook for September to December

2023 suggests an ongoing recovery, as

indicated by the most recent UNWTO

Confidence Index. However, this recovery is

expected to occur at a more moderate rate

compared to the peak travel season of June

to August. The demanding economic

circumstances may impact spending habits

for the rest of the year, with tourists showing

a growing preference for value-for-money

options, choosing to travel nearer to their

homes, and taking shorter trips.

Top ten source markets October 2023

In the month of October, India took the lead as the primary source of tourism to Sri Lanka, accounting for 26% of the total arrivals. Following closely were Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China, with each contributing 10%, 8%, 7%, and 6%, respectively. These statistics reflect changing preferences and travel patterns. Notably, there has been an increase in arrivals from China, India, Spain, and Germany in comparison to October last year, indicating a shift towards emerging destinations.

Several factors, such as improved air connectivity, favorable local conditions, geographical proximity, and geopolitical considerations, have collectively established these countries as the primary contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism.

The growth rates of tourist arrivals from different countries have been influenced by global and local dynamics. India, Spain, Germany, and Australia have experienced significant growth in arrivals, while Russia, the United Kingdom, and the Maldives have shown the slowest growth rates compared to October 2022. This variation in growth rates can be attributed to evolving trends and responses to the current global and local conditions.

Top ten source markets

January to October 2023

In the period from January to October 2023, Sri Lanka experienced an increase in international tourists from its key source markets compared to the same period in 2022. Notably, there was a significant surge in tourist arrivals from countries like India, China, Russia, the Maldives, the United States, and Australia during this timeframe, making a substantial contribution to the overall growth in tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka for the first ten months of 2023.

However, it's important to note that tourist arrivals from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Canada showed a decrease when compared to the same period last year. This suggests changing travel preferences and patterns for these specific regions.

October 2023

An analysis of the reasons behind tourists' visits to Sri Lanka reveals distinct patterns in their motivations. The majority, constituting 59% of all visits, chose Sri Lanka as a destination for leisure and vacation, emphasizing its popularity as a top choice for those in search of relaxation and enjoyable experiences. Additionally, 12% of tourists came to reconnect with friends and relatives, emphasizing Sri Lanka's ability to attract individuals with personal connections or a desire to nurture relationships with loved ones residing there. In contrast, business-related purposes accounted for a mere 6% of tourist visits, indicating a relatively small segment of visitors arriving for professional engagements. Furthermore, 5% of tourists arrived in Sri Lanka for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) purposes, highlighting the country's growing reputation as a venue for such events. Additionally, niche interests were represented, with 0.6% an d 0.036% visiting for health/Ayurvedic and educational purposes, respectively. These findings underscore Sri Lanka's multifaceted appeal and highlight its attractiveness as a destination that caters to a wide range of traveler preferences and goals.

In October, across all major markets, the primary reason for visiting Sri Lanka was leisure. Specifically, the data shows that a significant proportion of tourists from key source markets, including India (69%), Russia (37%), the United Kingdom (52%), Germany (70%), China (83%), Australia (47%), France (63%), the United States (46%), and Spain (82%), chose Sri Lanka as a destination for recreational purposes. This data underscores the country's strong appeal as a place for relaxation and enjoyable experiences. As illustrated by the purpose of visits statistics, October is not the favored month for visiting friends and relatives in Sri Lanka. Only 33% of British tourists, 39% of Australian tourists, 28% of American tourists, and 19% of French tourists primarily chose Sri Lanka as a destination to reconnect with friends and relatives. In addition, 13% of Indian tourists and 12% of Spanish visitors traveled to Sri Lanka for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) purposes.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report – October 2023

War's Shadow: The Impact of Israeli Conflict on Sri Lanka's Tourism

Israelis are renowned for their adventurous and wanderlust-filled nature, always eager to venture beyond their borders to explore the world, embrace diverse cultures, and embark on thrilling journeys. Notably, Israel's outbound travel sector has been experiencing remarkable growth. From 2010 to 2019, the number of Israeli international air travel increased more than twofold, surging from 3.6 million to 8.3 million, reflecting an impressive average annual growth rate of 10%(Ketter, n.d).

Israel stands out globally as a leader in the proportion of its population that seeks international adventures. Out of the approximately 9 million Israeli citizens, an astonishing 4.3 million took their travels overseas in 2019. The momentum continued into the first half of 2023 (January to June), with Israelis embarking on 4.5 million international journeys, surpassing the levels recorded in the previous peak year of 2019(Ketter, n.d.).What's striking is the diversity in age groups represented among these travelers, with around 20% of all international travelers from Israel being under the age of 20, underlining the broad appeal of outbound travel.

However, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has the potential to temporarily dissuade many adventure-seekers from pursuing their international travel dreams for tourism.

Israel plays a pivotal role as a source of tourism for Sri Lanka. Yet, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine holds the potential to exert a considerable influence on outbound tourism from Israel. It has the capacity to discourage or interrupt the travel plans of Israeli citizens.

As of October 31, 2023, the total count of Israeli tourists who have journeyed to Sri Lanka stands at 18,909 while the arrivals recorded for the month of October was 460. However, the daily trend in tourist arrival figures signals a gradual decline in the number of Israeli visitors as depicted in Chart 6.

Chart 6: Israel tourist arrivals from 2012 to October 2023

Monthly Tourits Arrivals Report –October 2023

Chart :7 Daily arrival distribution of tourist from Israel

This decline can likely be attributed to various factors.

Travel deterrence: In times of increased military conflict or war, a significant number of Israelis may opt to delay or altogether cancel their international travel arrangements. The apprehension of being far from their homeland during a crisis can discourage people from engaging in outbound tourism. Simultaneously, a substantial portion of the Israeli workforce has been mobilized for active duty, resulting in the removal of more than 300,000 ordinary workers from the economy, as they join the ongoing fight. The reserve force, consisting of approximately 450,000 members, comprises individuals from various segments of Israeli society, many of whom possess greater combat experience than the younger soldiers in the regular army. These reservists encompass a wide range of professions, including educators, technology professionals, startup entrepreneurs, agricultural workers, lawyers, medical practitioners, nurses, individuals from the tourism sector, and factory laborers( Gewirts, 2023).

Safety and Security Concerns: In light of the recent tragic incidents involving the deaths of two Israeli tourists in Egypt and incidents of assults to Israeli’s have caused growing worries about the safety and security of Israeli travelers, especially with the escalation of hostilities. These concerns may serve as a deterrent to potential outbound tourists.

Transportation Disruptions: During times of war, transportation infrastructure can face significant disruptions, making it challenging for travelers to access airports, train stations, or border crossings. This can lead to the cancellation or rescheduling of outbound flights and other modes of transportation. Several airlines, including American Airlines, Delta, United Airlines, Air Canada, Air India, and Korean Air, have already suspended or adjusted their air services to Israel (The Economic Times, 2023). Such disruptions could compel outbound travelers to either delay or completely cancel their travel plans. Additionally, the ongoing situation may necessitate the rescheduling of Israeli airline Arkia's inaugural nonstop service between Tel Aviv and Sri Lanka, originally planned for the fourth quarter of this year.

Monthly Tourits Arrivals Report –October 2023 14

Economic Ramifications: During periods of conflict, the economy can experience a range of adverse effects. This can lead to economic difficulties that impact the cost of living, employment opportunities, and various other aspects. As reported by Reuters(2023), the Bank of Israel has reduced its economic growth projections for 2023 from 3% to 2.3%. Consequently, Israelis may opt to curtail their consumption expenditures and opt to save funds in preparation for unforeseen circumstances arising from the current uncertainty.

As depicted in the above chart , remarkably, the Second Intifada of 2000 had a minimal effect on the travel intentions of Israelis, as outbound travel remained largely unaffected and continued to grow steadily, ultimately reaching 8,431,900 travelers in 2022. Hence, it's sensible to expect a gradual resurgence in outbound travel, underscoring the significance of avoiding premature assessments and hasty judgments regarding the complete scale and gravity of the damage resulting from the ongoing conflict

Top ten markets versus main last departure airports and main airlines to Sri Lanka October 2023

Tourists' choices when it comes to airlines and departure airports are heavily influenced by their home countries. For instance, Indian travelers commonly choose Sri Lankan Airlines and IndiGo, while Russian tourists tend to prefer Aeroflot and Red Wings. Conversely, Sri Lankan Airlines is a popular choice among tourists from the United Kingdom, Australia, Maldives, and France. Notably, German, American, and Spanish tourists often opt for Qatar Airways and use Doha as their primary departure hub. Emirates is a favored option for both German and British tourists.

This underscores the vital importance of accessibility in boosting tourism in Sri Lanka. It also emphasizes that tourists' choices regarding airlines and departure airports are significantly shaped by their home countries, highlighting the importance of convenient connections in drawing tourists to Sri Lanka. With the return of operations from airlines like Turkish Airlines in October and the introduction of other charter and scheduled flights in November, including Azur Air, Edelweiss, and Enter Air, the outlook for connectivity and an increase in tourists appears more promising.
