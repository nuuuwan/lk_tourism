Summary

In April 2023, Sri Lanka recorded 105,498 international tourist arrivals, which is a significant increase of 67.5% compared to the same period in 2022. This impressive growth brought the total number of tourists to 58% of pre-pandemic levels in 2018. However, compared to March 2023, there has been a decrease of 15.9% in tourist arrivals, which suggests the end of the peak season in Sri Lanka.

Generally, the surge in tourism can be attributed to various factors, including the high season for travel in Sri Lanka, improved socio-economic conditions, and better accessibility to the country. Additionally, the relaxation of travel restrictions in many countries has also played a crucial role in the recovery of the travel industry. The top countries of origin for tourists in April were India, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

April 2023

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe accounted for the majority of

tourists visiting Sri Lanka, representing

51.8% of total arrivals. The increase in

tourism is believed to be a result of growing

demand from countries such as the

Russian Federation, United Kingdom,

Germany, and France.

The Asia and Pacific region accounted for

37.6% of total tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka,

while the Americas and the Middle East

contributed 7.4% and 2.1% respectively.

The easing of travel restrictions and

enhanced air connectivity to Sri Lanka

could be the key drivers behind the growth

in tourism during this period.

UNWTO predicts that international tourism

will continue to recover in 2023, driven by

a rising demand for travel. However, the

sector's growth could be hindered by

several obstacles, including economic,

health-related, climatic, and geopolitical

factors that may impact its sustained

recovery.

Top ten source markets

April 2023

During March, Sri Lanka experienced a surge in international tourist arrivals, with the majority coming from India, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. India accounted for the highest percentage of arrivals at 19%, while the Russian Federation, United Kingdom, Germany, and France represented 14%, 8%, 7%, and 5% respectively. Improved air accessibility, favorable conditions within the country, proximity, and geopolitical factors continued to make India the primary source of tourism for Sri Lanka. Notably, there has been substantial growth in arrivals from countries like Russia, India, and the United States, while France and Germany have shown the lowest growth rates when compared to March 2022 likely due to the negative travel advisories and perceptions regarding Sri Lanka.

The United Kingdom witnessed a decrease of 24.2% in tourist arrivals compared to March 2022, which could be due to Sri Lankan diaspora visiting friends and relatives less frequently and a preference among British tourists for closer destinations like Spain, Italy, and France. When compared to March 2018, there was a significant 66% drop in tourist arrivals from the United Kingdom. Travel bag's analysis of the average Google search volume for holidays revealed that Maldives, Turkey, Thailand, Mexico, Egypt, and Barbados are among the top long-haul destinations for Brits in 2023.

These trends signify changes in outbound travel preferences and travel patterns, with growth in arrivals from India and Russia indicating a shift towards emerging destinations.
