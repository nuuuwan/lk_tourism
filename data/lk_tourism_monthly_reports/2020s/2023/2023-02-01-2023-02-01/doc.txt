Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during February 2023 was 107,639. This is an increase of 11.5% compared to February 2022 and reaching 46% pre pandemic levels (2018). This trend can be attributed to the peak travel season in Sri Lanka, as well as the other factors such as improved socio economic

conditions and increased connectivity to the country. In addition to the pent-up demand, the relaxation of travel restrictions in various source markets is also crucial in the travel recovery.The top countries of origin for tourists in February were Russian Federation, India, the United Kingdom, Germany and France.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

February 2023

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe emerged as the primary source of

tourists visiting Sri Lanka, accounting for

67.7% of total arrivals. It is believed that

pent-up demand from countries such as

the Russian Federation, UK, Germany,

France and Israel contributed to this

increase in tourism.

Meanwhile, 24.6% of tourists came from

Asia and the Pacific region, 5.4% from the

Americas, and 1.7% from the Middle East.

Factors such as the lifting of travel

restrictions and improved air accessibility

in Sri Lanka could be the factors that

contributed to the growth in tourism.

According to the UNWTO, international

tourism is expected to further recover in

2023 due to growing demand. However,the

international tourism's sustained recovery

may be hindered by economic, health,

climatic and geopolitical obstacles.

Top primary markets – February 2023

Note: The top primary markets for Sri Lanka have been identified using visitor arrivals data during the last six months. The previous methodology used to identify the markets was altered due to the current arrival trends in the source markets and the economic crisis in Sri Lanka. The intention is to track these source markets on a go-forward basis to understand future performance of Sri Lanka’s tourism economy, including during the projected international tourism recovery period, 2022-2025.

Top ten source markets

February 2023

In February, the top five countries that generated the most international tourism to Sri Lanka were the Russian Federation, India, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. The Russian Federation was the leading source of tourists, accounting for 27% of total arrivals. India accounted for 13%, the United Kingdom for 8%, Germany for 7%, and France for 6%. The Russian Federation remained the top source of tourism to Sri Lanka, owing to increased air accessibility via direct and charter flights from Russia and favorable conditions within Sri Lanka. A comparison of tourist arrival numbers recorded for February 2022 ,reveals that there has been significant growth in tourist arrivals for the Russian Federation (89.5), Australia (84.4), Canada (58.6), Israel (37.8), and the United States (31.7). It is worth noting that the growth recorded for Russia and Israel is particularly significant, as tourist arrivals from these countries increased by 123.5% and 42.8%, respectively, compared to pre-COVID levels in 2019.

On the other hand, there has been a decline of 19.4% in tourist arrivals from the United Kingdom compared to February 2022. This decline could be attributed to factors such as a decrease in Sri Lankan diaspora visiting their friends and relatives, as well as a preference for short-haul destinations such as Spain, Italy, and France.

Overall, the growth in tourist arrivals for Russia and Israel and the decline in arrivals from the United Kingdom could be indicative of shifting trends in outbound travel preferences and changes in diaspora travel patterns.
