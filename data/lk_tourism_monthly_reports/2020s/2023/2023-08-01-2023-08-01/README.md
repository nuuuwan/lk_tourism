Summary

In August 2023, Sri Lanka experienced a surge in international tourist arrivals compared to the same period in 2022. The number of foreign tourist arrivals soared by 261.2% year-on-year, reaching a total of 136,405 visitors. This substantial upswing can be attributed to various key factors driving the revival of Sri Lanka's tourism sector. These factors include the ongoing recovery of the tourism industry, a pent-up demand for travel following pandemic-related restrictions, improvements in air connectivity, and the reopening of China as a pivotal market for tourism. Notably, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has expressed confidence in the continuity of this positive trend throughout the year, underscoring Sri Lanka's potential for sustained growth in tourism. This surge aligns with a broader global trend of recovering international tourism, reflecting the allure of Sri Lanka's diverse attractions, encompassing its rich culture, natural beauty, and historical sites,

which continue to captivate travelers from around the world.

In the period from January to August 2023, the cumulative count of tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka reached an impressive 904,318, surpassing the figures from the previous year, which recorded 496,430 arrivals.

In August 2023, Sri Lanka's tourism sector saw a significant influx of visitors, with India, the United Kingdom, China, Germany, and Russia emerging as the top five source markets. These countries played a pivotal role in driving the surge in tourist arrivals, contributing substantially to the overall recovery of Sri Lanka's tourism sector.

Additionally, when comparing tourist arrivals in August 2023 to July 2023, there was a notable decrease of 4.6%. This decline in arrivals indicates a temporary dip in tourist activity during this period. It's important to consider various factors that could contribute to such fluctuations, including seasonal variations, and other external factors impacting tourism trends.

In August, the primary source markets for tourism in Sri Lanka were India, the United Kingdom, China, Germany, and Russia. India accounted for the largest share of arrivals at 32%, while the United Kingdom, China, Germany, and Russia represented 15%, 10%, 9%, and 7% of arrivals, respectively.
