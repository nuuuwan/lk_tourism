Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during January 2023 was 102,545. This is an increase of 24.5% compared to January 2022 and reaching 43% pre pandemic levels (2018). This trend can be attributed to the peak travel season in Sri Lanka, as well as the other factors such as resumed cruise tourism

and increased connectivity to the country. In addition to the pent-up demand, the relaxation of travel restrictions in various source markets is also crucial in the travel recovery.The top countries of origin for tourists in January were Russian Federation, India, the United Kingdom, Germany and France.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

January 2023

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe emerged as the primary source of

tourists visiting Sri Lanka, accounting for

66.1% of total arrivals. It is believed that

pent-up demand from countries such as

the Russian Federation, UK, Germany,

France and Israel contributed to this

increase in tourism.

Meanwhile, 25.3% of tourists came from

Asia and the Pacific region, 6.4% from the

Americas, and 1.5% from the Middle East.

Factors such as the lifting of travel

restrictions and improved air accessibility

in Sri Lanka could be the factors that

contributed to the growth in tourism.

According to the UNWTO, international

tourism is expected to further recover in

2023 due to growing demand. However,the

international tourism's sustained recovery

may be hindered by economic, health and

geopolitical obstacles.
