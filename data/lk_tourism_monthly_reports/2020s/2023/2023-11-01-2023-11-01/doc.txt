Summary

In November of 2023, Sri Lanka witnessed a remarkable upswing in the influx of international tourists, marking the highest number of arrivals for the entire year. The number of foreign visitors experienced a remarkable surge of 153.5%, totaling 151,496 arrivals. This surge can be attributed to the commencement of the peak tourism season and favorable conditions in Sri Lanka. From January to November 2023, Sri Lanka accomplished a noteworthy milestone in cumulative tourist arrivals, surpassing the previous year's count of 628,017 and reaching an impressive total of 1,276,951 visitors. During November 2023, Sri Lanka's tourism sector observed a substantial

surge in visitors, with India, Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia emerging as the primary source markets. These nations played a pivotal role in driving the increase in tourist arrivals, making substantial contributions to the overall revitalization of Sri Lanka's tourism industry. As per UNWTO, the rate of recovery may experience a slowdown in Q4 2023 due to prevailing economic and geopolitical challenges. Nonetheless, it is expected that the total number of international arrivals will reach 1.3 billion in 2023. Despite enduring economic challenges such as high inflation and diminished output, coupled with specific geopolitical tensions and conflicts, international tourism is on a path towards regaining pre-pandemic levels by the year 2024.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

November 2023

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Sri Lanka experienced a notable influence

from Europe, comprising a significant share

of tourists, accounting for 53% of the total

arrivals. Concurrently, Asia and the Pacific

assumed the lead as the primary source

market for tourists visiting Sri Lanka,

constituting 40.2% of the overall influx. This

shift in the origin of tourists underscores the

changing dynamics within Sri Lanka's

tourism industry, with Europe playing a

substantial role and Asia and the Pacific

emerging as crucial contributors.

The upswing in tourism can be credited to the

increasing demand from countries such as

India, Russia, Germany, the United

Kingdom, and Australia, all of which have

played pivotal roles in fortifying Sri Lanka's

tourism sector. To delve deeper into these

contributions, the Americas constituted 5% of

the total tourist arrivals, while the Middle East

and Africa contributed 1.4% and 0.5%

respectively. Each of these regions has

played distinct and discernible roles in

shaping the characteristics of Sri Lanka's

tourism landscape.

As per the latest World Economic Outlook released by the International Monetary Fund in October 2023, there is an indication of a sluggish and uneven global recovery. The forecast predicts a decline in global growth from 3.5% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2023. The escalation of geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Palestine remains a significant factor, posing potential risks to international tourism throughout the remaining months of 2023 and extending into 2024. Consequently, the achievement of Sri Lanka's target of attracting 1.5 million tourists is anticipated with varying numbers of tourists expected from different regions of the world.

Top ten source markets

January to November 2023

From January to November 2023, Sri Lanka witnessed a rise in international tourist numbers from its primary source markets in comparison to the corresponding period in 2022. Notably, there was a notable upswing in tourist arrivals from countries such as India, Russia, China, the Maldives, and Australia during this span, significantly contributing to the overall growth in tourist numbers in Sri Lanka for the initial eleven months of 2023.

However, it's crucial to highlight that tourist arrivals from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Canada displayed a decline in comparison to the same period the previous year. This implies evolving travel preferences and patterns specific to these regions.

An examination of the motivations behind tourists' visits to Sri Lanka reveals distinct trends in their reasons for traveling. A majority, accounting for 58% of all visits, selected Sri Lanka as their destination for leisure and vacation, highlighting its widespread popularity as a top choice for those seeking relaxation and enjoyable experiences. Another 8% of tourists came to reconnect with friends and relatives, emphasizing Sri Lanka's ability to attract individuals with personal connections or a desire to nurture relationships with loved ones residing there. In contrast, business-related purposes made up only 4% of tourist visits, indicating a relatively small segment of visitors arriving for professional engagements. Additionally, 5% of tourists arrived in Sri Lanka for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) purposes, showcasing the country's growing reputation as a venue for such events. Furthermore, niche interests were represented, with 0.6% and 0.036% visiting for health/Ayurvedic and educational purposes, respectively. These findings underscore Sri Lanka's multifaceted appeal and highlight its attractiveness as a destination that caters to a wide range of traveler preferences and goals.

First Experimental Tourism Satellite Account for Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka stands as a favored destination for tourists seeking an island retreat, offering captivating features such as stunning beaches, rich wildlife, cultural experiences, and traditional healthcare services. This thriving tourism sector not only generates income and livelihoods but also contributes significantly to foreign exchange earnings. Despite its evident importance, there has been a lack of information regarding its specific contribution to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To address this gap, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) initiated a study aimed at establishing the country's first Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), aligning with international guidelines set by the World Tourism Organization.

The information below delineates the TSA for the reference year 2018, recognizing its experimental nature due to limitations in available data. Despite encountering specific challenges that impeded the creation of an all-encompassing TSA, this inaugural effort has played a crucial role in surmounting obstacles for subsequent TSAs, with the groundwork for this ongoing process already laid.

Inbound Tourism

Data utilized for the estimation of Inbound Tourism Expenditure was derived from the "Survey on Departing Foreign Tourists" (SDFT), conducted by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) from January to December 2018. It is important to note that the primary objective of conducting SDFT-2018 was to gather fundamental tourism statistics, assess the profile of tourists, and understand their travel patterns. The survey was not specifically designed to cater to the requirements of the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA). Consequently, detailed information on expenditure related to tourism products and services was not readily available. However, these details were approximated using the existing data on average per-tourist expenditure and the distribution of various expenditure components within the total expenditure. The key findings derived from TSA Table 1 are outlined below:

• The average non-package per-tourist and per-night expenditure was estimated to be USD 181.15.

• The broad components, namely, accommodation, transport within country, eating out activities, shopping and others contributed 32.4 percent, 17.0 percent, 25.0 percent, 12.2 percent, and 13.4 percent respectively to the total non-package tourism expenditure.

• Converting the percentage shares to absolute numbers gave the breakup of USD 181.15.

• The average duration of stay for an inbound tourist is estimated at 11.15 nights.

• The estimated number of tourists arriving in Sri Lanka in 2018, is 2.33 million.

• The multiplication of per-tourist expenditure with estimated number of tourists and average duration of stay gave the estimated values of expenditure in USD terms. This worked out to be USD 4713.77.

• On further multiplying this with the USD to LKR exchange rate gave the inbound non-package tourism expenditure as LKR 766150.

• Further, share of non-package tours in total is estimated to be 83 percent. Accordingly, total inbound expenditure (including both package and non-package components) worked out to be LKR 923,072 million.

• The broad components were mapped with the TSA products and services and using the proportions as seen in domestic tourism expenditure for these products and services, the inbound tourism expenditure was estimated for all products and services. Hence, TSA Table 1 could be prepared for Sri Lanka Experimental TSA.

• The table reveals that 27.6 percent of total inbound tourism expenditure was incurred on food and beverage. This was followed by land transport services, and Accommodation services accounting for 22.5 percent and 17.8 percent respectively.

• The inbound tourists spent about 22 percent of their total expenditure on Country-specific goods and services.

• The per-tourist inbound expenditure is estimated at LKR 395,524.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report – November 2023 13

Domestic Tourism

To estimate the domestic tourism expenditure, data was obtained from Sri Lanka Tourism Expenditure Survey (SLTES), conducted by Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) for the year 2017-18 (Oct 2017 to Aug 2018). The domestic tourism expenditure was collected at fairly disaggregated level. Hence, the TSA Table 2 on Domestic Tourism Expenditure could be prepared directly from the survey findings.

The key findings are as follows:

 Total domestic tourism expenditure is estimated at LKR 38,255 million.  Of the total domestic tourism expenditure, the highest, at 37.2 percent, is spent on country-specific goods.  Land passenger transport is the popular mode of transport among both inbound and domestic tourists . Food and beverage account for 17.9 percent and all other products and services account for only 13.7 percent of total domestic expenditure.  The average per-tourist expenditure is estimated at LKR 5475. Among the different purposes for travel, the highest per-tourist expenditure is recorded for a holiday/leisure trip, at LKR 8837. On the other hand, a health trip turns out to be the least expensive, at LKR 4242.

Outbound Tourism

In the case of Sri Lanka, there is no data on outbound tourism expenditure. Hence this part of the tourism expenditure cannot be presented in the experimental TSA.

Total Internal Tourism Expenditure

The summation of Inbound and Domestic Tourism Expenditure is the Total Internal Tourism Expenditure for Sri Lanka. This table shows that:

 The Sri Lankan tourism economy is driven by inbound tourism, which contributes as much as 96 percent to total tourism expenditure.  Inbound tourism accounts for more than 90 percent of expenditure on almost all the tourism related products and services, except water transport services, country-specific goods, and other consumer goods and services, for which domestic tourism makes up for 21 percent, and 11.6 percent each respectively.  The per-tourist expenditure incurred in the case of inbound trip in Sri Lanka is over 72 times more than that of a domestic trip.

Supply Side data

The supply side data for tourism specific industries was obtained from Sri Lanka’s Supply and Use Table (SUT) for 2018 prepared by Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) Sri Lanka. These data are presented in TSA Table 5. In the core TSA Table, that is, Table 6, the demand side data and supply side were brought together, as per the recommended guideline.

Tourism Satellite Account

 Tourism Direct Gross Value Added (TDGVA) is estimated to be LKR 467,975 million for 2018, or 3.34 percent of national GVA (LKR 14,014,197 million).  In terms of GDP, Tourism Direct GDP (TDGDP) is estimated at LKR 512,645 million. The total Gross Domestic Product for 2018 was LKR 15,351,933 million. Hence, the contribution of TDGDP to national GDP is also estimated at 3.34 percent.  This refers to the direct share of tourism to Sri Lanka economy, as per the country’s first experimental TSA.
