Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during March 2023 was 125,495. This is an increase of 17.8% compared to March 2022 and reaching 54% pre pandemic levels (2018). The surge in tourism can be credited to several factors including the high season for travel in Sri Lanka, as well as improvements in socio-economic conditions and enhanced

accessibility to the country. Furthermore, the easing of travel limitations in various countries is also a key factor in the recovery of the travel industry. In March, the primary countries from which tourists arrived were the Russian Federation, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share March 2023

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

The majority of tourists visiting Sri Lanka,

which accounted for 58.9% of total arrivals,

originated from Europe. This rise in tourism

is thought to be driven by a buildup of

demand from countries like the Russian

Federation, the United Kingdom, Germany,

and France.

Meanwhile, 30.9% of tourists came from

Asia and the Pacific region, 8.1% from the

Americas, and 1.4% from the Middle East.

Factors such as the lifting of travel

restrictions and improved air accessibility

in Sri Lanka could be the factors that

contributed to the growth in tourism.

According to UNWTO, international

tourism is predicted to continue its recovery

in 2023, mainly driven by an increasing

demand for travel. However, it is important

to note that the sector's growth could be

impeded by various challenges such as

economic, health-related, climatic, and

geopolitical factors, which may affect its

sustained recovery.

Top ten source markets

March 2023

In March, Sri Lanka received the most international tourists from the Russian Federation, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, with the Russian Federation leading the pack at 20% of total arrivals. The percentage shares recorded for India, United Kingdom, Germany and France were 15%, 9%, 8% and 5%. The Russian Federation remained the primary source of tourism to Sri Lanka due to increased air accessibility, favorable conditions within the country and geopolitical factors. When comparing tourist arrival figures for March 2022, it is notable that there has been substantial growth in arrivals from countries such as Russia, Australia, China, and the United States. The growth rates recorded for Russia and Iran, in particular, were remarkable, as they increased by 101% and 265%, respectively, compared to pre-COVID levels in March 2019. In contrast, France and Germany had the lowest growth rates in comparison to March 2022, which could be attributed to negative travel advisories and perceptions about Sri Lanka.

In contrast, there was a decrease of 14.3% in tourist arrivals from the United Kingdom and an 18.3% decrease in tourist arrivals from India compared to March 2022. This decline in tourist arrivals could be attributed to factors such as a reduction in Sri Lankan diaspora visiting their friends and relatives and a preference for short-haul destinations such as Spain, Italy, and France, especially among tourists from the United Kingdom. Comparing the decline in tourist arrivals to March 2019, the United Kingdom and China recorded drops of 63% and 87%, respectively, which could be attributed to COVID-related travel restrictions, particularly in China.

Overall, the growth in tourist arrivals for Russia and Iran and the decline in arrivals from the India and the United Kingdom could be indicative of shifting trends in outbound travel preferences and changes in travel patterns.
