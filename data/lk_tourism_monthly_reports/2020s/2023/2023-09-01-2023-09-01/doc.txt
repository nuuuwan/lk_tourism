Summary

In September 2023, Sri Lanka witnessed an upswing in the number of international tourist arrivals compared to the same period in 2022. The influx of foreign tourists surged by an impressive 275.6% year-on-year, totaling 111,938 visitors. However, the month of September traditionally experiences lower tourism numbers, and the decrease in arrivals compared to August reflects this pattern. This underscores the importance of promoting Sri Lanka as an attractive year-round destination for future growth and development in the tourism sector. From January to September 2023, Sri Lanka's cumulative tourist arrivals reached an outstanding milestone of 1,016,256, surpassing the previous year's figure of 526,232 arrivals, and

surpassing the significant one million tourist arrivals mark.

During September 2023, the tourism sector in Sri Lanka experienced a substantial influx of visitors, with India, China, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Russia emerging as the top five source markets. These nations played a pivotal role in driving the surge in tourist arrivals, significantly contributing to the overall recovery of Sri Lanka's tourism sector. It is noteworthy that September 2023 recorded the highest percentage change in arrivals compared to the same month in the previous year, highlighting the impressive growth in Sri Lanka's tourism industry during that period.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

September 2023

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

The tourism landscape in Sri Lanka saw a

notable influence from Asia and the Pacific,

making up a substantial portion of tourists,

comprising 52.1% of the total arrivals.

Concurrently, Europe took the forefront as

the primary source market for tourists

visiting Sri Lanka, accounting for 41.1% of

the overall influx. This transformation in the

origins of tourists underscores the

changing dynamics within Sri Lanka's

tourism industry, with Asia and the Pacific

being a significant contributor and Europe

emerging as a vital source of tourists.

The rise in tourism can be credited to

increasing demand from nations such as

India, China, the United Kingdom,

Germany, and Russia, all of which have

significantly bolstered Sri Lanka's tourism

industry.

To delve deeper into these contributions,

the Americas have made up 4.6% of the

total tourist arrivals, while the Middle East

has contributed 1.5%. These regions have

each played distinctive roles in influencing

the dynamics of Sri Lanka's tourism

landscape.

The latest UNWTO Confidence Index

suggests that the period from September to

December 2023 indicates ongoing

recovery in the tourism sector. However,

this recovery is expected to occur at a more

gradual pace compared to the peak travel

season of June to August.

Tourism tale: Sri Lanka’s path to a million tourists

In 2023, Sri Lanka is set to achieve an ambitious target of welcoming 1.55 million tourists, representing substantial growth compared to the 719,978 tourists it received in 2022. By September 2023, the country had already greeted 111,938 tourists, signifying a notable upswing in tourism. However, it's essential to acknowledge that these figures remain below the levels observed in 2018.

Monthly forecasts for 2023 paint a positive picture, with actual tourist arrivals consistently exceeding the predicted numbers, especially from February to July. This trend suggests a promising trajectory for tourism as Sri Lanka steadily recovers from various challenges.

September 2023 stands out with the highest percentage increase compared to 2022, marking an extraordinary 275.6% rise. Additionally, July recorded the highest number of arrivals for the year, reaching an impressive 143,039 tourists. Monthly variations in arrivals reflect seasonal changes influenced by holidays, weather patterns, and other factors, underlining the dynamic nature of tourism in the country.

Noteworthy is Sri Lanka's achievement of surpassing one million tourists in September, marking a significant milestone. After 2019, this is the first time that Sri Lanka has experienced such a substantial increase in tourist arrivals, exceeding the one-million mark. During the initial eight months of the year, India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France dominated as the top source markets for Sri Lankan tourism, contributing significantly to the influx of tourists. Furthermore, China has emerged as a prominent market among these top source countries.

Sri Lanka's tourism sector is poised for a notable resurgence, attributed to several factors such as improved accessibility, recent prestigious accolades, and other advancements. Nevertheless, as per the UNWTO, the challenging economic environment may influence spending patterns in the remaining part of the year. Travelers are increasingly emphasizing value for their money, favoring nearby destinations, and opting for shorter vacations.
