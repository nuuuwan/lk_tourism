Summary

The “Monthly Tourists Arrivals Report” is a publication by the Research Team at Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) that monitors monthly tourist arrivals and trends to provide industry stakeholders with an up-to-date overview of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka. The statistics in this report are derived from immigration data.

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during August 2021 was 5,040. A considerablegrowth (albeit low volume)in arrivals in the month of August can be observed following the sharp contraction in arrivals after the month

of April. This could reflect the improvement in international arrivals owing to factors such as increase in vaccination programmes around the world, softer restrictions for vaccinated travellers, and growing consumer confidence. As of 31st

August 2021, 24,377 tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year, a decline of 95.2% over last year when 507,311 tourists had visited the country from January to 18th March, 2020.

The largest source markets recorded for the month of August 2021 were Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom, followed by Pakistan, and India.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

August 2021

Map 1. Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 48.1% of the total traffic received in August 2021. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 31.8% of the total traffic while the Americas accounted for 18.1%. In comparison to August last year, all regions have recorded a decline in arrivals. Despite the minor improvements

observed with the reopening of borders, the recovery of international tourism remains fragile and uncertain due to rising concerns over the Delta variant of COVID-19 and other variants that are gradually developing especially in Asia and the Pacific region (source: UNWTO Barometer, July 2021).

Safety and security in the post-COVID-19 global travel market

Health and safety factors will have a major influence over travel consumer destination choice and vacation planning going forward. As leisure travel resumes and at least for the short term (i.e., Q3 2021 to Q2 2022), price will be more important than ever, however the Chinese are an exception to this trend (see chart 2 below).

 The Chinese market represents an opportunity to recover some lost revenue for the tourism sector.  A significant minority of travel consumers in all markets indicate they would be willing to pay more, suggesting that there is potential to develop viable sustainable tourism options.  A combination of safety and price – offering safe and secure experiences at a competitive rate in a strained market, at least in the short-term, is likely to drive tourism traffic more than sustainability.  Though there is an increasing degree of crossover between “responsible” and COVID-19-safe travel.

Chart 1: Travel consumers are broadly willing to pay more for higher quality experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2021)

Methodology Note: Charts 1 and 2 are based on an opinion survey of a representative sample of n=1,000 identified travel consumers in each of 10 outbound travel markets. Fieldwork was carried out online in May 2021, using market research panels. A representative sample of the online population in each market was drawn and stratified by age, gender and region. This sample was then sent a survey invitation by email, and respondents screened to identify leisure travellers. These were defined as those who either: 1. Had taken an international overnight holiday/vacation trip in the past three years (i.e., since May 2018); or 2. Are likely to take an international overnight holiday/vacation trip in the next three years (i.e., by May 2024).

Results are representative of the online adult traveller population in each market and are considered accurate within +/- 2 to 3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The survey uses a questionnaire developed by Twenty31 Consulting.

Chart 2: Travel consumers are less willing to pay extra for vacation experiences certified by a third party as socially and environmentally responsible (May2021)

• According to recent research conducted by an American-based marketing company, concerns around COVID-19 are set to continue to dominate, though the slowdown of the pandemic is also having an increasing influence.However, the availability of travel deals is showing increasing impact.

• These results indicate that travel consumers are starting to think beyond the pandemic and consider what kinds of packages may be available to them.Destinations that are able to offer highly competitive packages in compliance with the growing consensus around safety and security will benefit in “the new normal”.

Top ten source markets August 2021

Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Pakistan and India were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets in the month of August, 2021. Canada was the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 12% of the total traffic received in the above period. Germany accounted for 10% of the total traffic. The growth in arrivals from countries in the Americas, and Western, Central & Eastern Europe, suggests a slight revitalization of leisure tourism, potentially driven by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence,the lifting of travel restrictions,

the roll out of COVID-19 vaccine programs and the North American and Western Europe summer holiday period. Further,the desire to visit friends and relatives (VFR) could have highly motivated travel consumers,especially from Canada and the United Kingdom to visit Sri Lanka during this period. The presence of Pakistan and India in the top source markets is noteworthy despite the surge in the Delta variant in the region and the travel restrictions for Indians (which were partially relaxed at the end of August).

Top ten source markets January – August 2021

Kazakhstan, Ukraine, China, India and the United States were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist-generating markets from January to August this year. All the countries in the top ten markets from January to August, 2021, recorded declines in arrivals in comparison to the same period in 2020, likely due to the persistence and unprecedented growth of the pandemic situation around the globe. It is noteworthy the that total arrivals up to August from Kazakhstan had recordedgrowth in comparison to total arrivals up to August 2020, likely owing to the pilot project carried out to revive the tourism industry following a 10-month pandemic-induced closure.
