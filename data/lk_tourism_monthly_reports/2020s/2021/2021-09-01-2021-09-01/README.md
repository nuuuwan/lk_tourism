Summary

The “Monthly Tourists Arrivals Report” is a publication by the Research Team at Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) that monitors monthly tourist arrivals and trends to provide industry stakeholders with an up-to-date overview of international tourism to Sri Lanka. The statistics in this report are derived from immigration data.

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during September 2021, was 13,547. A considerable growth in arrivals in the month of September can be observed following the sharp contraction in arrivals after the month of

April. This could reflect the improvement in international tourism owing to factors such as an increase in vaccination programmes around the world, softer restrictions for vaccinated travellers, and growing consumer confidence. As of 30th

September 2021, 37,924 tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year, a decline of 92.5% over last year when 507,311 tourists had visited the country from January to 18th March, 2020.

The largest source markets recorded for the month of September 2021,were India, Pakistan and Germany,followed by the United Kingdom and Russia.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

September 2021

Map 1. Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Asia and the Pacific became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 78.9% of the total traffic received in September 2021. Given the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the region, this can be considered as significant growth. Geographic proximity being one of the main drivers of destination choice now, pent up demand especially from countries such as China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Europe accounted

for 17.3% of the total traffic while the Americas accounted for 3.2%. In comparison to September last 2020, all regions have recorded a decline in arrivals. However, as recovery continues an increase in arrivals could be anticipated as a keen enthusiasm and readiness to travel and explore the world again is demonstrated by travellers, enabled by access to vaccines and easing of border restrictions.

Safety and security in the post-COVID-19 global travel market, cont’d

While major health concerns still prevail in the global travel market, travel consumers are looking to the future and, in most markets according to a study by Twenty31 in May 2021, majorities say that they are very or somewhat likely to take an international holiday in the next 3 years.

• The Chinese market is the most enthusiastic in this response, with 98% very or somewhat likely. • This is followed by Poland, Germany, and the UK all at 97%. • The lowest likelihood is observed in Russia which still exhibits 92% who are very or somewhat likely to take an international holiday by April 2024.

• These results indicate that, while approaching travel with trepidation due to the prevalence of health concerns, travel consumers are likely to be highly receptive to credible reassurance and open to good reasons to feel safe while travelling.

Chart 1: Likelihood to take an international holiday in the next 3 years(May 2021)

Proximity is the main driver of recent travel patterns. In all markets, travellers had most commonly made their most recent international holiday in a neighbouring country- Americans going to Canada, Italians going to France, or Chinese going to Japan.

Methodology Note: Charts 1 and 2 are based on an opinion survey of a representative sample of n=1,000 identified travel consumers in each of 10 outbound travel markets. Fieldwork was carried out online in May 2021, using market research panels. A representative sample of the online population in each market was drawn and stratified by age, gender and region. This sample was then sent a survey invitation by email, and respondents screened to identify leisure travellers. These were defined as those who either: 1. Had taken an international overnight holiday/vacation trip in the past three years (i.e., since May 2018); or 2. Are likely to take an international overnight holiday/vacation trip in the next three years (i.e., by May 2024).

Results are representative of the online adult traveller population in each market and are considered accurate within +/- 2 to 3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The survey uses a questionnaire developed by Twenty31 Consulting.

Question: Thinking about the past three years, what was the last international overnight holiday/vacation trip you took? If you visited more than one country on this trip, please think about the main country that you visited

Top ten source markets September 2021

India, Pakistan, Germany,the United Kingdom, and Russia were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets in the month of September, 2021. India was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 63% of the total traffic received in September. Pakistan and Germany accounted for 9% and 3% of the total traffic respectively.The growth in arrivals from countries in the Americas, and Western, Central & Eastern Europe, suggests a slight revitalization of leisure tourism, potentially enabledby factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions,

the roll out of COVID-19 vaccine programs, and the North American and Western Europe summer holiday period. Further,the desire to visit friends and relatives (VFR) could have highly motivated travel consumers,especially from Canada and the United Kingdom to visit Sri Lanka during this period. The presence of Pakistan and India in the top source markets is noteworthy. Easing of border restrictions, the gradual containment of the pandemic and promotions on air tickets especially for Indian tourists could be the likely factors that influenced the growth in arrivals.

Top ten source markets January –September 2021

India, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Germany, and the United kingdom, were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist-generating markets from January to September this year. All the countries in the top ten markets from January to September, 2021, recorded declines in arrivals in comparison to the same period in 2020, likely due to the persistence and unprecedented growth of the pandemic situation around the globe. It is noteworthy that total arrivals up to September from Kazakhstan had recorded a growth in comparison to total arrivals up to September 2020, likely owing to the pilot project carried out to revive the tourism industry following a 10-month pandemic-induced closure.
