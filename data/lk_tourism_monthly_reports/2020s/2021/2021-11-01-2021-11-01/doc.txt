Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during November 2021 was 44,294. A considerable improvement during the month of November can be noticed following the sharp contraction in arrivals after the month of April, 2021. This reflects the improvement in international arrivals potentially owing to factors such as vaccination advances around the world, softer restrictions for vaccinated travellers, use of digital tools to facilitate safe travel, such as the EU COVID Certificate and

growing consumer confidence in some outbound source markets. As of 30th November 2021, 104,989 international tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. It is a decline of 79.3% over last year when 507,311 tourists had visited the country from January to 18th March, 2020.

The largest source markets recorded for the month of November were India, the United Kingdom, and Russia, followed by Germany and Pakistan.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share November 2021

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Asia and Pacific became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 48.8% of the total traffic received in November 2021. Given the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the region, this can be considered as significant growth. Geographic proximity being one of the main drivers of destination choice now, pent up demand especially from countries such as China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Europe accounted for 41.9% of the total traffic while the Americas accounted for 5.6%.

In comparison to November last year, all regions have recorded a decline in arrivals. Even though signs of recovery were evident, the uncertainity for the travel industry is mounting again with countries already practicing restrictions and border closures with the emergence of the new Omicrom variant. In addition, increasing cases in Europe will further dampen consumer confidence which was gradullay building after the devastating Delta variant.

Top ten source markets November, 2021

India, the United Kingdom, Russia,Germany and Pakistan were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets for the month of November this year. India was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 32.1% of the total traffic received in November. The United Kingdom and Russia accounted for 8.5% and 8% of the total traffic respectively.The growth in arrivals from countries in the Americas, and Western, Central & Eastern Europe, suggests a slight revitalization of leisure tourism, potentially enabled by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions, the increased roll out of COVID-19 vaccine programs, and the North American and Western Europe summer holiday period. Various accolades received highlighting Sri Lanka tourism in mainstream media, could have had some effect in boosting interest

in Sri Lanka, however destination marketing is cumunaltive and this recent PR will need to be followed up to have any lasting impact. However, with the surge in COVID cases in the Europen region it is anticipated that the current growth momentum will decline in the coming months.

The desire to visit friends and relatives (VFR) likely highly motivated travel consumers,especially from Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Malaysia to visit Sri Lanka during this period. The presence of Pakistan and India in the top source markets is noteworthy. Easing of border restrictions, the gradual containment of the pandemic and a continued promotion of air tickets especially for Indian tourists could be the likely factors that influenced the growth in arrivals..

Chart 1. Comparison of arrivals from top ten markets to Sri Lanka, Nov/Oct 2021

Top ten source markets January –November 2021 India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Kazakhstan and Ukraine were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist-generating markets from January to November this year. All the countries, except Kazakhstan in the top ten markets from January to November, 2021, recorded declines in arrivals in comparison to the same period in 2020, likely due to the persistence of the pandemic situation and new COVID-19 outbreaks around the globe, Omicrom being the most recent. It is noteworthy that total arrivals up to November from Kazakhstan had recorded a growth in comparison to total arrivals up to November 2020, likely owing to the pilot project carried out to revive the tourism industry following a 10-month pandemic-induced closure.

The below tables depict the main last departure airports and airlines analyzed by top markets to Sri Lanka. The data further hints to the importance of destination accessibility in driving visitation.

With the resumption of flights by SriLankan Airlines to Paris from November, the percentage share of the passengers using SriLankan Airlines in comparison to October 2021, has increased.

In addition, as a new direct flight, Aeroflot has been patronised by 16.8% of tourists from Russia. As depicted in Table 5, 76.3% of Indians have used SriLankan Airlines in travelling to Sri Lanka and this could be likely due to the air ticket promotion offered to Indian tourists. Table 4.
