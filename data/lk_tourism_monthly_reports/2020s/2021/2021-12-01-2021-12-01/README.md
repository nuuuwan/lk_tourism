Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during December 2021 was 89,506. A significant improvement during the month of December can be noticed following the sharp contraction in arrivals after the month of April, 2021. This reflects the improvement in international arrivals potentially owing to factors such as vaccination advances around the world, softer restrictions for vaccinated travellers, use of digital tools to facilitate safe travel, such as the EU COVID Certificate and

growing consumer confidence in some outbound source markets. As of 31st December 2021, 194,495 international tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. It is a decline of 61.7% over last year when 507,704 tourists had visited the country from January to December, 2020.

The largest source markets recorded for the month of December were India, Russia, the United Kingdom, followed by Germany and Ukraine.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share December 2021

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 54.4% of the total traffic received in December 2021. Given the escalating number of COVID-19 cases, this can be considered as significant growth. Pent up demand especially from countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Ukraine is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Asia and Pacific accounted for 37.2% of total arrivals. Americas accounted for 5.4% of the total traffic while the Middle East accounted for 2.5%.

In comparison to December last year, all regions have recorded a decline in arrivals. Even though signs of recovery were evident, the uncertainity for the travel industry is mounting again with countries already practicing restrictions and border closures with the emergence of the new Omicrom variant. It is anticipated that, increasing cases in Europe will further dampen consumer confidence which was gradullay building after the devastating Delta variant.

Top ten source markets December, 2021

India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Ukraine were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets for the month of December this year. India was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 26.3% of the total traffic received in December. Russia and the United Kingdom accounted for 12% and 9.5% of the total traffic respectively.The growth in arrivals from countries in the Americas, and Western, Central & Eastern Europe, suggests a slight revitalization of leisure tourism, potentially enabled by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions, the increased roll out of

COVID-19 vaccine programs. However, with the surge in COVID cases in the European region it is anticipated that the current growth momentum will decline in the coming months.

The desire to visit friends and relatives (VFR) likely highly motivated travel consumers, especially from Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia to visit Sri Lanka during this period. The persistance of India in the top source markets is noteworthy. Easing of border restrictions, the gradual containment of the pandemic could be the likely factors that influenced the growth in arrivals..

Chart 1. Comparison of arrivals from top ten markets to Sri Lanka, Dec/Nov 2021

Top ten source markets January –December 2021 India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Ukraine were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist-generating markets from January to December this year. All the countries, except Kazakhstan in the top ten markets from January to December, 2021, recorded declines in arrivals in comparison to the same period in 2020, likely due to the persistence of the pandemic situation and new COVID-19 outbreaks around the globe, Omicrom being the most recent. It is noteworthy that total arrivals up to December from Kazakhstan had recorded a growth in comparison to total arrivals up to December 2020, likely owing to the pilot project carried out to revive the tourism industry following a 10-month pandemic-induced closure. In addition, a similar growth was observed from the countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon.

Top ten markets versus main last departure airports and main airlines to Sri Lanka, December 2021

The below tables depict the main last departure airports and airlines analyzed by top markets to Sri Lanka. The data further hints to the importance of destination accessibility in driving visitation. Establishing direct air access especially to Europe is key to increasing tourism and in identifying this, steps were taken to launch direct flights with several airlines such as Aeroflot, Azur Air, Neos, Air France, US-Bangla, Arkia and Swiss Air, commencing from November. With the resumption of flights by Sri Lankan Airlines to Paris from November, the percentage share of the passengers using Sri Lankan Airlines in comparison to November 2021, has increased. Further, it is noteworthy that 10.2% of passengers from France have used Air France in travelling to Sri Lanka. In addition, as a new direct flight, Aeroflot has been patronised by 21.1% of tourists from Russia. Sri Lankan Airlines and IndoGo are the most preferred airlines for Indians in travelling to Sri Lanka.
