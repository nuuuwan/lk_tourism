Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during October 2021, was 22,771. A modest improvement in the month of October can be noticed following the sharp contraction in arrivals after the month of April. This reflects the improvement in international arrivals owing to factors such as vaccination advances around the world, softer restrictions for vaccinated travellers, use of digital tools to facilitate safe travel such as the EU COVID

Certificate and growing consumer confidence. As of 31st October 2021, 60,695 tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. It is a decline of 88% over last year when 507,311 tourists had visited the country from January to 18th March.

The largest source markets recorded for the month of October 2021 were India, United Kingdom, Pakistan, Russia and Germany.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share October 2021

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Asia and Pacific became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 56.4% of the total traffic received in October 2021. Given the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the region, this can be considered as significant growth. Geographic proximity being one of the main drivers of destination choice now, pent up demand especially from countries such as China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India is likely to have driven this growth momentum.

Europe accounted for 36.3% of the total traffic while the Americas accounted for 5.7%. In comparison to October last year all regions have recorded a decline in arrivals. However, as recovery continues an increase in arrivals could be anticipated as keen enthusiasm and readiness to travel and explore the world again is demonstrated by travellers, enabled by access to vaccines and easing of border restrictions.

Destination Promotion in New Normal

The gradual curtailment of COVID 19 and the reopening of borders has increased hope for a gradual return of international tourism. Enthusiastic travellers bord by the lockdowns that confined them for extended periods are keen to explore the world again. Yet the visitor experience in many destinations has changed and various hurdles remain including decreased flights, quarantines and social distancing restrictions. However, tourism promotion in this post-COVID period will never be the same again. Researchers points out that although promotion will be necessary for tourism markets to awaken from the lethargy after the initial impact, marketing, communications and travel trade engagement should not be the same as before. The strategies of tourist destination organizations will not only be based on promotion, but also on reconfiguring the offer in the light of the new social reality resulting from the COVID-19 (Toubes, et al., 2021). While certain destination organizations have reduced or postponed their marketing efforts there were others who have found ways of engaging potential customers while they are in lockdowns. However, the fluctuations in demand and supply caused by the reopening of borders and related factors have necessitated the destinations to readjust their marketing strategies as per the changing traveller needs and behaviours. In encountering this challenge successfully, Google and a leading global management consultancy have developed a five ‘R’ approach to guide DMOs (Alassaf and Bergman, 2020).

1. Reassess their offerings and value proposition in light of evolving traveler preferences,

needs, and concerns.

2. Reassure travelers on the safety of travel to their chosen destination by addressing

their health concerns.

3. Raise awareness of the destination, including added safety measures and local

government regulations, to inspire consumers.

4. Remove barriers in converting consumers to travelers by making the case for traveling

with conscientious health and safety measures in place.

5. Revive spend in the local economy by supporting tourism.

Having identified the transformations occurring in the industry Sri Lanka tourism too has modified its marketing efforts to include a global tourism campaign, winter campaign promotions through advertising and social media and travel trade promotional campaigns. Further recent accolades and recognitions received for Sri Lanka, such as being one of the top wellness tourism destinations by the Global Wellness Institute, best countries to explore for nature lovers by Times of India and best countries to travel by Conde Nast Traveler Readers’ Choice awards will add value and supplement the ongoing promotional efforts. It is anticipated that the gradual developments in vaccination that will lead to curtailment of the pandemic will progressively strengthen traveller confidence leading to a moderate rebound in international arrivals in the remaining months of the year.

Top ten source markets October, 2021

India, United Kingdom, Pakistan, Russia and Germany were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets for the month of October this year. India was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 37% of the total traffic received in October. The United Kingdom and Pakistan accounted for 10% and 9% of the total traffic respectively.The growth in arrivals from countries in the Americas, and Western, Central & Eastern Europe, suggests a slight revitalization of leisure tourism, potentially enabled by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions, the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccine programs,

the North American and Western Europe summer holiday period, and various accolades received to Sri Lanka tourism. Further,the desire to visit friends and relatives (VFR) could have highly motivated travel consumers, especially from Canada, the United Kingdom and Malaysia to visit Sri Lanka during this period. The presence of Pakistan and India in the top source markets is noteworthy. Easing of border restrictions, the gradual containment of the pandemic and promotions on air tickets especially for Indian tourists could be the likely factors that influenced the growth in arrivals. .

Top ten source markets January – October 2021 India, United Kingdom, Germany, Kazakhstan and Ukraine were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist-generating markets from January to October this year. All the countries, except Kazakhstan, recorded declines in arrivals in comparison to the same period in 2020, likely due to the persistence of the pandemic situation and potential new COVID-19 outbreaks around the globe. It is noteworthy that total arrivals up to October from Kazakhstan had recorded a growth in comparison to total arrivals up to October 2020, likely owing to the pilot project carried out to revive the tourism industry following a 10-month pandemic-induced closure.
