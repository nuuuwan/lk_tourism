Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report November 2025

Summary

Sri Lanka's tourism sector demonstrates strong recovery momentum, with visitor arrivals through the first eleven months of 2025 showing substantial growth compared to the corresponding period in 2024. When comparing the two years month by month, every recorded month in 2025 shows positive growth over 2024, highlighting increased traveller confidence. The cumulative arrivals from January to November already amount to 2,103,593, demonstrating a solid upward trajectory and a growth of 16.6% in comparison to same period last year.

Seasonal patterns remain evident, yet the growth is spread across almost all periods of the year. The highest increase is observed in September, which recorded an impressive 30.2% rise, suggesting that Sri Lanka is successfully attracting more visitors during the traditional shoulder season. Strong double digit growth is also visible in January, June, October, April, May, August, and November, which collectively point to a consistent rise in demand across multiple tourism periods.

This indicates that the recovery is not limited to the high season, but rather is balanced throughout the year, enhancing sector resilience.

Several factors are likely contributing to the strong growth performance. Improved air connectivity, especially from India, the Middle East, Russia, and key European markets, is likely to have supported increased arrivals. In addition, the global tourism rebound during 2025 appears to be benefitting the country as travellers continue returning to destinations offering nature, culture, and outdoor experiences.

Overall, the data portrays a sector that is recovering steadily and strengthening throughout 2025. If December follows the year’s growth patterns, Sri Lanka could achieve its growth targets, marking an encouraging milestone in post-crisis recovery. The consistent expansion across most months reflects improving competitiveness and growing global interest, positioning the tourism industry for further growth in the coming years.

Tourist arrivals by purpose of visit November 2025

An analysis of arrival patterns by the travel motivations reflects the island's diverse appeal as

a multifaceted destination catering to varied traveler motivations. Leisure and vacation travel constituted the predominant segment, accounting for 68.86% (146,608 arrivals) of total visitors. This substantial proportion underscores Sri Lanka's established reputation as a premier holiday destination, attracting travelers seeking authentic cultural experiences, pristine beaches, wildlife encounters, and adventure tourism opportunities.

Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Events (MICE) tourism emerged as the second-

largest category with 22,130 arrivals (10.39%), demonstrating Sri Lanka's growing competitiveness in the business events sector. This segment represents significant potential for high-yield tourism, typically generating substantial per visitor expenditure while promoting the destination during off peak seasons.

VFR travel accounted for 14,627 arrivals (6.87%), representing an important diaspora driven

segment that maintains strong connections between Sri Lanka and its global community. This category often results in extended stays, dispersed economic benefits across regions, and authentic cultural exchange.

Business travel contributed 5,740 arrivals (2.70%), indicating commercial connectivity and

trade relationships. Notably, health and Ayurvedic tourism attracted 1,681 visitors (0.79%), highlighting Sri Lanka's potential in wellness tourism and traditional medicine. Religious tourism (981 arrivals, 0.46%), sports tourism (682 arrivals, 0.32%), and education related travel (167 arrivals, 0.1%) represent emerging niche markets with opportunities for targeted development and marketing strategies.

The diversified purpose of visit profile demonstrates Sri Lanka's ability to appeal to multiple

market segments simultaneously. While leisure tourism remains the foundation, the significant MICE component and emerging specialized segments indicate a maturing tourism economy with enhanced resilience. Strategic focus on strengthening niche segments, particularly health and wellness, sports tourism, and educational travel presents opportunities for sustainable growth, seasonal balance, and differentiated market positioning in an increasingly competitive regional landscape.

Chart 5: Purpose of visit vs main source markets

The disaggregated data by source market reveals distinct travel motivations across key markets, offering critical insights for targeted destination marketing and product development strategies. Several markets demonstrate overwhelming leisure orientation, with France (81.97%), Spain (81.23%), Germany (80.15%), and United Kingdom (76.22%) leading in holiday travel. These Western European markets exhibit classic vacation travel patterns, seeking Sri Lanka's cultural heritage, beaches, and nature-based experiences. Poland (76.55%) similarly reflects strong leisure demand, while Russian Federation (71.46%) and China (69.72%) maintain substantial holiday travel components. This pattern validates Sri Lanka's positioning as an exotic, experience-rich destination for long haul European travelers and indicates opportunities for premium leisure product development. Significant variation exists in MICE travel across markets. Poland (18.03%) and Russian Federation (18.66%) show exceptionally high MICE participation, suggesting strong business event connectivity and corporate incentive travel from these markets. India (13.02%) and Spain (11.96%) also demonstrate robust MICE segments. Conversely, traditional leisure markets like United Kingdom (2.87%), Australia (2.33%), and Germany (5.38%) show minimal MICE activity. This disparity indicates opportunities to promote Sri Lanka's conference and events infrastructure more aggressively to Western European corporate markets while maintaining strong MICE partnerships with Eastern European and South Asian business communities. Australia (26.30%) exhibits the highest VFR proportion, reflecting Sri Lanka's significant diaspora population in Australia and strong bilateral migration ties. United States (18.87%) and United Kingdom (13.93%) similarly show elevated VFR travel, consistent with established Sri Lankan communities in these countries. VFR travel represents stable, recession resistant demand with extended stay patterns and dispersed regional economic impact.

China (7.36%) demonstrates the highest business travel proportion, reflecting growing trade relationships and investment activities. India (4.45%) shows moderate business travel, while most other markets register minimal business specific visits (below 2%). Germany (4.98%) emerges as the leading market for health and Ayurvedic tourism, significantly outperforming all other source markets. This indicates strong German awareness and appreciation of Sri Lanka's traditional medicine offerings. Spain (0.56%), Poland (0.38%), and France (0.30%) show modest but notable wellness tourism interest. The exceptionally low penetration from India (0.01%), Russian Federation (0.13%), and United Kingdom (0.18%) represents untapped potential, particularly given India's cultural familiarity with Ayurveda and Russia's historical wellness tourism propensity. Religious tourism remains marginal across all markets, with India (0.53%) and Poland (0.51%) showing the highest rates likely reflecting Buddhist pilgrimage from India and Catholic heritage tours from Poland. Sports tourism registers minimal presence across all markets (under 0.5%), indicating significant development potential. Educational travel similarly shows limited penetration, with United Kingdom (0.13%) and United States (0.11%) representing small student exchange or academic conference activity.

Natural Disasters and Tourism Recovery: Global Lessons and Sri Lanka's Own Journey Forward

Introduction

Natural disasters strike without warning, leaving devastation in their wake and testing the resilience of nations and communities. For countries where tourism serves as a vital economic pillar, the impact extends far beyond immediate physical damage, cancellations cascade, confidence erodes, and livelihoods hang in the balance. As Sri Lanka confronts the aftermath of a catastrophic cyclone, we stand at a critical juncture. Yet history offers us hope as nations across the world have faced similar crises and emerged stronger, transforming tragedy into opportunity through strategic action, unwavering determination, and collective effort.

Importantly, Sri Lanka itself carries recent, hard-won lessons from two profound crises that, while not natural disasters, devastated the tourism sector with equal force, the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic. These experiences, painful as they were, have equipped our nation with invaluable insights into crisis management, recovery strategies, and the remarkable resilience of both our tourism industry and our people.

The Global Pattern: Crisis and Recovery

The relationship between natural disasters and tourism follows a recognizable pattern. Initial shock leads to sharp declines in visitor arrivals, in affected regions. This immediate crisis phase, however, represents only the beginning of the journey. What distinguishes successful recovery stories from prolonged decline is not the severity of the disaster itself, but rather the quality, speed, and coordination of the response that follows.

Post-disaster tourism decline can be attributed to three interconnected factors. Direct physical impacts compromise a destination's operational capacity to receive and serve tourists. Beyond infrastructural concerns, heightened risk perception leads travelers to avoid areas they consider dangerous. Additionally, moral and ethical considerations may deter potential visitors who question the appropriateness of tourism activity in communities experiencing hardship and recovery. (Kozak et al., as cited in Rosselló et al.)

Media representation also significantly influences public risk perception. Continuous exposure to disaster coverage creates an impression of escalating global vulnerability among general audiences. The tourism sector exemplifies how perception shapes reality, as travelers select destinations through both rational assessment and subjective evaluation. Consequently, destination risk perception has emerged as a critical determinant in tourist decision-making behavior ( Becken et al. as cited in Rosselló et al.).

Despite these formidable challenges, numerous destinations have successfully navigated post-disaster recovery and rebuilt their tourism sectors, offering valuable lessons in resilience and strategic intervention.

Thailand's Resilience: Community at the Heart of Recovery

The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami devastated Thailand's iconic coastal destinations Phuket, Khao Lak, and the Phi Phi Islands. The loss was immeasurable, yet Thailand's response showcased the power of combining rapid infrastructure development with community-centered recovery.

Rebuilding began immediately, focusing on hotels, beaches, and transport networks. But Thailand went further, establishing strict safety protocols and early warning systems to prevent future tragedies. Community-based tourism projects ensured that local populations weren't just passive recipients of aid but active participants in rebuilding their own futures.

Within two years, tourist arrivals had rebounded dramatically. Phuket reclaimed its position as one of the world's premier beach destinations, and tourism became the engine driving broader economic recovery. Thailand demonstrated that when communities are empowered and safety is prioritized, confidence returns rapidly (Karantzavelou,2007).

The Caribbean's United Response: Strength in Collaboration

When Hurricanes Irma and Maria tore through the Caribbean in 2017, individual islands faced catastrophic damage. Yet the region's response illustrated the power of collective action. The "Caribbean Is Open" campaign was strategically brilliant it acknowledged affected areas while emphasizing that many destinations remained ready to welcome visitors.

This transparent, coordinated approach prevented the entire region from being tarred by impacts affecting only certain islands. Quick restoration of cruise ports and airports maintained connectivity, while hotels rebuilt using climate-resilient designs that promised greater safety for the future. By 2019, cruise arrivals had surged beyond pre-hurricane levels, and several islands reported their strongest tourism numbers in history.

The Caribbean's experience underscores a crucial lesson: in an interconnected tourism ecosystem, coordinated regional messaging can protect and restore confidence more effectively than isolated individual efforts (News deck, 2017).

The Path Forward for Sri Lanka

As Sri Lanka begins its cyclone recovery journey, it is not done as novices in crisis management but as a nation that has faced profound challenges before and emerged stronger. The immediate task involves honest assessment of damage, transparent communication with international markets, and rapid restoration of critical tourism infrastructure.

The integration of comprehensive emergency and disaster response plans across all tourism sectors is no longer optional but essential for future resilience. Creating strong links between tourism and disaster risk reduction is particularly critical in destinations heavily dependent on tourism. Business enterprises and attraction sites in the tourism sector require strong disaster management capacity to formulate appropriate early warning mechanisms and response protocols. This includes incorporating tourist well-being into emergency plans, with clear evacuation procedures and visitor protection strategies. The shift must move from reactive response and recovery approaches toward proactive reduction and readiness strategies. By embedding disaster preparedness into every level of tourism operations, Sri Lanka can minimize future disruptions, protect both visitors and communities, and demonstrate the professional crisis management capabilities that rebuild international confidence This cyclone, devastating as it is, affects specific geographic areas rather than the entire destination. Unlike the Easter attacks that created nationwide security concerns, or COVID-19 that closed borders completely, cyclone recovery allows targeted restoration in affected areas while maintaining operations in unaffected regions.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report November 2025

This geographic specificity can actually accelerate overall destination recovery if we communicate clearly about where tourism can continue immediately and where focused rebuilding is occurring.

Sri Lanka can leverage lessons from the Caribbean's "Caribbean Is Open" campaign, emphasizing that significant portions of Sri Lanka remain ready to welcome visitors while affected areas undergo rapid restoration. COVID-19 experience can be applied with domestic tourism to maintain some economic activity in the sector during international market recovery. Easter attack recovery experience can be used to manage international perceptions and gradually rebuild confidence through demonstrated progress.

Conclusion

Natural disasters test nations in profound ways, but they also reveal character and catalyze transformation. Japan, Thailand, the Caribbean, and countless other destinations have proven that tourism can not only recover from catastrophic events but can emerge more resilient, sustainable, and successful than before.

Sri Lanka's tourism story carries its own chapters of crisis and recovery. Sri Lanka has faced terrorism that targeted our visitors and our values. Sri Lanka has weathered a global pandemic that closed our borders and silenced the airports. Each time, Sri Lanka demonstrated that the spirit of Sri Lankan hospitality, the beauty of the island, and the resilience of people cannot be broken by any crisis.

This cyclone represents another challenge, but it is one that is faced with experience, knowledge, and proven capacity for recovery. Past recovery efforts have illuminated the path forward. Trust returns through transparent communication, recovery accelerates with rapid infrastructure restoration, effectiveness multiplies through coordinated action, and future disruption diminishes with resilience investment.

The global community has shown that destinations which respond with transparency, speed, coordination, and vision don't just survive disasters; they demonstrate the resilience and adaptability that make them even more compelling to visitors seeking authentic, meaningful travel experiences. Sri Lanka has already proven this truth through our own recovery journeys.

The path forward will demand dedication, investment, and collaboration. Yet this journey is not undertaken as novices, but as a nation that has learned, adapted, and strengthened itself through past adversity. The tourism sector will recover, as it has done before, and visitors will once again be received with the warmth and graciousness that have long been the hallmarks of Sri Lankan hospitality

This is not the first crisis Sri Lanka has faced, nor will it be the last. The recent cyclone has posed significant challenges, yet both global and national history demonstrate a clear path to recovery. It is now a collective responsibility to move forward with confidence shaped by experience and with hope anchored in proven resilience. Sri Lanka's recovery story is already being written, and like the stories that came before, it will be one of determination, collaboration, and ultimate triumph.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report November 2025

Main last departure airports and airlines to Sri Lanka,

November 2025

The distribution of tourist arrivals across last departure airports reveals Sri Lanka's connectivity landscape, market access patterns, and strategic gateway dependencies.

Dubai emerges as the primary gateway with 25,319 arrivals (11.89%), reflecting Sri Lanka's strategic positioning on East West travel corridors, and the UAE's role as a global aviation hub. Doha follows with 19,402 departures (9.11%), demonstrating Qatar Airways' significant market penetration. Abu Dhabi contributes 16,416 arrivals (7.71%), completing the Middle Eastern trio that collectively accounts for 28.71% of all arrivals. This concentration underscores the critical importance of Gulf carrier partnerships and the vulnerability of Sri Lanka's tourism sector to Middle Eastern aviation dynamics, geopolitical stability, and airline commercial strategies.

Indian cities constitute the second-largest gateway cluster. Chennai leads with 16,240 arrivals (7.63%), benefiting from geographic proximity and strong cultural-historical ties. Mumbai (11,350, 5.33%), Bangalore (9,850, 4.63%), Delhi (8,901, 4.18%), and Hyderabad (5,273, 2.48%) collectively represent 24.25% of total arrivals, demonstrating India's position as a crucial source market with multiple direct connectivity points. The diversified Indian gateway portfolio indicates both leisure and business travel across multiple cities, reducing dependency on single-point connectivity.

Kuala Lumpur (7,370, 3.46%) and Singapore (6,092, 2.86%) serve as Southeast Asian hubs, facilitating connections from broader Asia-Pacific markets including Australia, Indonesia, and East Asia. Bangkok (3,532, 1.66%) provides supplementary regional connectivity. Shanghai (3,217, 1.51%) and Hong Kong (3,291, 1.55%) represent Chinese market access, though relatively modest volumes suggest limited direct China connectivity, likely reflecting visa policies, direct flight availability, or broader Chinese outbound travel patterns.

London (6,526, 3.07%) stands as the primary European gateway. Istanbul (8,985, 4.22%) demonstrates Turkish Airlines' significant role in connecting European and Middle Eastern travelers. Zurich (2,467, 1.16%) and Paris (1,876, 0.88%) show limited continental European direct connectivity, suggesting many European travelers route through Middle Eastern hubs. Moscow (6,633, 3.12%) indicates dedicated Russian Federation connectivity, consistent with that market's strong performance.

In Europe, London is the dominant gateway, supported by British Airways and Sri Lankan Airlines, while Istanbul plays a strong connecting role through Turkish Airlines. Other European cities such as Zurich and Paris contribute smaller volumes, suggesting most European arrivals transit via Middle Eastern hubs. Moscow reflects stable Russian connectivity. Long-haul access from Melbourne shows modest Australian volumes, with many travelers likely connecting via Asian hubs

Leveraging Sri Lanka’s geographic position as a regional hub, optimizing seasonal routes, and improving airport infrastructure including Colombo and regional airports would support traffic growth, reduce hub dependency, and enhance tourism sector resilience.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report November 2025

The data on main airlines utilized by tourists reveals a high concentration of tourist traffic on low cost and regional carriers. Sri Lankan Airlines dominates with a significant 24% share, which can be attributed to its status as the national carrier offering extensive regional connectivity and frequent flights to Colombo. Following closely is Indigo, with a 12% share, underscoring strong tourist inflow from India and highlighting the importance of budget-conscious travel options for visitors to the island. Furthermore, there is a strong presence of Middle Eastern carriers, collectively accounting for a substantial portion of arrivals. Qatar Airways (9%), Emirates (8%), and Etihad Airways (7%) together make up 24% of the share, indicating that a major gateway for tourists, especially from long-haul markets like Europe and the Americas, is through the hubs in the Gulf region. This points to Sri Lanka's connectivity via these global transit points as a critical factor in its tourism flow. The data also shows moderate usage of a diverse set of other international airlines. Carriers such as Turkish Airlines, Air India, Air Arabia, Fly Dubai, and Red Wings Airlines each hold around 4-5% of the share. This diversity suggests healthy tourist interest from varied origin markets, including Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and India, reflecting Sri Lanka's broadening appeal across Eastern Europe, the CIS nations, and the Middle East. In contrast, the usage of major Asian and Western carriers appears minimal. Airlines like Singapore Airlines, Air China, China Eastern, and Cathay Pacific each account for only 1-2% of the tourist traffic. This relatively low share may indicate fewer direct flight connections or less targeted promotional efforts in these regions, presenting a potential growth opportunity to attract more visitors from East and Southeast Asia through improved air links and marketing initiatives. Overall, the popularity of low-cost and budget airlines like Air Asia, Air Arabia, and Indigo highlights the price-sensitive nature of a significant segment of tourists traveling to Sri Lanka. The data suggests that affordable travel options are a key driver, particularly from neighboring India and the Middle East. Sri Lanka's tourist arrivals are heavily reliant on its national carrier and regional budget airlines, with Middle Eastern hubs playing a crucial bridging role, while opportunities exist to deepen engagement with airlines from other Asian and Western markets.

Top ten markets versus main last departure airports and Main airlines to Sri Lanka November 2025

Table 5. Top ten markets vs. main last departure airports to Sri Lanka, November 2025

Data revealing tourists' last port of departure before arriving in Sri Lanka provides critical insights into routing preferences, hub dependencies, and direct versus indirect connectivity patterns across key source markets.

Indian travelers (51,391 total) demonstrate highly dispersed routing with Chennai (14,101, 27.4%) as the dominant departure point, followed by Mumbai (9,652, 18.8%) and Bangalore (8,668, 16.9%), collectively accounting for 63.1% of Indian arrivals.

Russian travelers (24,953 total) show concentrated departure patterns with Moscow (6,523, 26.1%) as the primary gateway, but notably Sharjah (2,755, 11.0%), Abu Dhabi (2,737, 11.0%), and Dubai (2,378, 9.5%) collectively account for 31.5% of Russian departures. This significant Gulf hub routing suggests Russian travelers either stopover in the UAE or utilize Gulf carriers for competitive pricing and connectivity.

UK travelers (16,915 total) exhibit London (5,080, 30.0%) as the dominant departure point, yet significant volumes route through Dubai (2,200, 13.0%), Doha (2,891, 17.1%), and Abu Dhabi (1,613, 9.5%), collectively representing 39.6% of UK arrivals. This substantial Middle Eastern hub dependency indicates many UK travelers utilize Gulf carriers rather than direct British Airways or Sri Lankan Airlines services, likely driven by pricing, frequency, or connecting itineraries from regional UK airports.

German travelers (14,518 total) demonstrate heavy Middle Eastern hub dependency with Doha (3,506, 24.1%), Dubai (2,913, 20.1%), and Abu Dhabi (2,156, 14.9%) accounting for 59.1% of departures. Limited direct connectivity from German cities forces reliance on Gulf carriers.

21

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report November 2025

Australian travelers (9,384 total) show highly fragmented routing with Singapore (2,768, 29.5%) as the leading hub, followed by Kuala Lumpur (1,153, 12.3%) and diverse other Asian connections. Chinese travelers (9,217 total) route primarily through Shanghai (2,635, 28.6%) and Hong Kong (1,518, 16.5%), yet substantial volumes also depart from Dubai (196), Kuala Lumpur (562), Bangkok (455), indicating many Chinese travelers utilize third-country hubs

French travelers (8,459 total) exhibit extreme hub dependency with Dubai (2,396, 28.3%), Doha (1,850, 21.9%), and Istanbul (1,508, 17.8%) collectively accounting for 68.0% of departures. Direct Paris departures are minimal, forcing French travelers to route through Middle Eastern or Asian hubs, indicating a significant direct connectivity gap for this important European market. Polish travelers (5,331 total) demonstrate concentrated patterns with Dubai (1,413, 26.5%), Sharja (820,15.3%) and Abu Dhabi (640, 12.0%) accounting for 49.3% of departures. American travelers (5,284 total) show highly dispersed routing through Doha (943, 17.8%), Dubai (482, 9.1%). Spanish travelers (4,666 total) route through Doha (1,677, 35.9%), Abu Dhabi (1,192, 25.5%), and Dubai (705, 15.1%), collectively representing 76.5% of departures.

This routing analysis reveals that while Sri Lanka benefits from Gulf carrier connectivity, strategic over-dependence creates vulnerability. Prioritizing direct services to key European cities, Australian gateways, and potentially North American hubs would reduce dependency, enhance destination competitiveness, and stimulate market growth through improved accessibility.

Table 6. Top ten markets vs. main airlines to Sri Lanka, November 2025

The distribution of airline preferences across key source markets reveals distinct carrier dominance patterns, routing behaviours, and strategic implications for airline partnerships and destination marketing.

Indian travelers demonstrate strong preference for Indigo (42.17%) and Sri Lankan Airlines (39.35%), collectively capturing 81.52% of the Indian market. Air India (12.42%) adds supplementary capacity. This pattern reflects India's competitive low-cost carrier market

(Indigo), combined with Sri Lankan Airlines' extensive Indian network and historical bilateral connectivity.

Russian travelers show remarkable concentration with Red Wings Airlines (41.87%) capturing the plurality, followed by Aeroflot (19.77%) and Air Arabia (11.04%). The combined 72.68% market share of Russian carriers indicates strong direct service from Moscow, though the significant Air Arabia presence (11.04%) suggests budget-conscious travelers utilize UAE-based low-cost carriers.

UK travelers favour Sri Lankan Airlines (38.08%) as the leading carrier, yet Qatar Airways (17.14%), Emirates (11.58%), and various other carriers collectively represent 62% of the market. This fragmentation indicates competitive pressure from Gulf carriers despite direct London service. German travelers demonstrate overwhelming Gulf carrier preference with Qatar Airways (24.11%) and Emirates (18.09%) capturing 42.20%, complemented by Etihad Airways (14.62%). Australian travelers heavily favor Sri Lankan Airlines (44.48%) and Singapore Airlines (22.72%), collectively representing 67.20% of the market. This indicates successful direct Colombo-Melbourne/Sydney services complemented by Singapore hub connectivity. Chinese travelers show remarkable concentration with China Eastern Airlines (36.45%) capturing over one-third of the market, followed by Air China (17.39%) and Cathey Pacific (15.86%). The combined 69.70% Chinese carrier share indicates strong bilateral aviation relationship and direct service preference. French travelers exhibit extreme Gulf carrier dependency with Emirates (26.27%) and Qatar Airways (21.69%) capturing 47.96%, supplemented by Turkish Airline (17.83%). Polish travelers demonstrate concentrated preferences with Fly Dubai (18.66%), Air Arabia (15.38%), among top carriers. American travelers exhibit highly fragmented carrier preferences with Sri Lankan Airlines (19.42%) leading, followed by Qatar Airways (17.75%)

Spanish travelers show extreme Gulf carrier concentration with Qatar Airways (36.65%) and Etihad Airways (25.44%) capturing 62.09%, complemented by Emirates (14.10%). Combined Gulf carrier share reaches 76.19%, the highest among analyzed markets.

This carrier preference analysis reveals that while SriLankan Airlines maintains strong positions in key markets, Gulf carrier dominance in European corridors creates strategic vulnerability. Prioritizing direct European services, strengthening alliance partnerships, and expanding low-cost carrier collaborations would enhance market competitiveness, reduce hub dependency, and improve destination accessibility across diverse traveler segments.
