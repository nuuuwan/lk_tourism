Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report July 2025

Summary

Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka show robust growth in 2025, with arrivals for January July reaching 1,368,288, a significant 14.2% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Every month in 2025 recorded higher arrivals than its 2024 counterpart, with particularly strong growth in January (+21.4%), June (+21.8%), May (+18.5%), and April (+17.3%). While growth moderated somewhat in February (+10.0%), March (+9.62%), and notably in July (+6.6%), the overall trend is positive. Having already achieved 67% of 2024's full-year total within the first seven months, and with the peak season (August-December) still ahead,

Sri Lanka is well positioned to significantly surpass the 2024 total of 2,053,465 arrivals barring major disruptions. This positive trend may suggests the effectiveness of factors such as improved airline connectivity, and streamlined visa processes.

In July, key source markets including India, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, China, and France played a pivotal role in revitalizing Sri Lanka’s tourism sector. Their strong contributions significantly boosted tourist arrivals and supported the continued growth of the industry during this period.

Tourist arrivals by regions reveals a highly concentrated source market for Sri Lanka's tourism, dominated overwhelmingly by Europe and Asia & the Pacific. Europe is the single largest source region, contributing 103,349 arrivals (51.6%), representing more than half of all tourists. Asia & the Pacific is the second major contributor, accounting for 80,272 arrivals (40.08%). Together, these two regions account for a substantial 91.68% of total tourist arrivals. The Americas represent a much smaller segment at 11,182 arrivals (5.6%), while the Middle East (4,188 arrivals, 2.1%) and Africa (1,253 arrivals, 0.6%) currently constitute very minor source markets. This distribution underscores Sri Lanka's strong appeal to traditional European holidaymakers and its proximity driven advantage within Asia, while highlighting significant potential for growth diversification, particularly in the Americas and Middle Eastern markets.The sustained high arrival numbers from Asia & Pacific and Europe can be attributed to steady travel demand, robust air connectivity, cultural appeal, and attractive travel packages. In contrast, the lower figures from the Middle East and Africa may stem from limited direct flight options, reduced marketing outreach, or lower awareness of Sri Lanka as a travel destination. This regional concentration reveals a level of vulnerability, especially if disruptions impact the dominant source markets.

Tourist arrivals by purpose of visit

July 2025

Sri Lanka attracted 200,244 international visitors in July 2025, demonstrating its growing

recovery as a tourist destination. Leisure travelers dominated arrivals, accounting for 56% (111,910 visitors) who came primarily for holidays and recreational purposes, underscoring the island nation's enduring popularity for its pristine coastlines, rich cultural heritage, and diverse natural attractions.

The diaspora connection remained significant, with visitors coming to see friends and

relatives representing 14.30% (28,635 people) of total arrivals, reflecting the valuable role of overseas Sri Lankan communities in sustaining tourism flows. Meanwhile, the meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE) sector captured 5.42%( of arrivals, while business travelers comprised 2.22%, both indicating untapped potential that could be expanded through enhanced infrastructure development and focused marketing strategies.

Several specialized tourism segments showed minimal presence but offer promising

growth prospects: sports tourism (0.6%), Health and Ayurvedic treatments (0.3%), religious pilgrimages (0.2%), and educational travel (0.08%). These areas remain significantly underutilized despite Sri Lanka's natural advantages in traditional medicine, spiritual tourism, and cultural learning experiences.

Moving forward, Sri Lanka's tourism strategy should focus on consolidating its position in the leisure market. Priority should be given to developing high potential niche markets, particularly wellness tourism, the MICE industry, and diaspora focused travel products through strategic partnerships and targeted promotional campaigns.

Chart 5: Purpose of visit vs main source markets

Analysis of visitor purpose by origin country reveals distinct travel patterns and

motivations among Sri Lanka's international tourists. European markets demonstrate the

strongest leisure orientation, with travelers from the Netherlands leading at 82.79%,

followed by Spain (80.63%), France (66.04%), and Germany (63.27%). This trend

confirms Sri Lanka's established reputation among Europeans as an attractive destination

for beach holidays, cultural exploration, and nature-based experiences. However,

markets like Canada (21.92%) and China (41.86%) exhibit considerably lower leisure

percentages, suggesting these visitors have different primary motivations.

The visiting friends and relatives (VFR) segment shows particularly strong representation

with Canada recording the highest share at 67.39%, followed by the United Kingdom

(37.03%), United States (33.40%), and Australia (30.85%). This pattern clearly illustrates

how Sri Lankan diaspora communities continue to drive significant tourism volumes from

these markets.

Behind the Wonder: Challenges Facing Elephants and the Tourism Industry in Sri Lanka Sri Lanka's majestic elephants have long captured the imagination of visitors from around the world, serving as both the crown jewel of the island's tourism industry and a symbol of its rich natural heritage. However, beneath the surface of wildlife safaris and elephant encounters lies a deepening crisis that threatens not only these magnificent creatures but also the sustainable future of Sri Lankan tourism.

The Tourism Draw: Elephants as Economic Assets

Elephants have been integral to Sri Lanka's tourism appeal for decades. The island nation, home to approximately 7,000 Asian elephants, offers visitors unique opportunities to witness these giants in their natural habitat across renowned national parks such as Yala, Udawalawe, Minneriya, and Wilpattu. Wildlife tourism, with elephants as a primary attraction, represents a significant component of Sri Lanka's tourism revenue, drawing thousands of international visitors annually who seek authentic wildlife experiences.

The Escalating Death Crisis

Behind this tourism success story, however, lies an alarming reality that threatens the very foundation of elephant based tourism. Sri Lanka is experiencing unprecedented elephant mortality rates that have reached crisis proportions in recent years.

The statistics paint a sobering picture with staggering number of deaths recorded each year. The trend appears to be continuing into 2025, with reports indicating the grave side of this phenomenon.

These deaths are not merely numbers but represent a systematic decimation of Sri Lanka's elephant population. What makes this crisis particularly acute is that roughly half of these deaths are directly attributable to human actions, including illegal electric fencing, shooting, poisoning, and train strikes as railway lines bisect traditional elephant corridors.

The Tourism Industry's Dilemma

This escalating elephant mortality crisis presents a paradoxical challenge for Sri Lanka's tourism industry. While tourists continue to flock to the island seeking elephant encounters, the very attractions they come to see are disappearing at an alarming rate. The loss of iconic tuskers, the large male elephants with prominent tusks that are particularly popular with tourists has been especially devastating for wildlife viewing experiences.

The tourism industry finds itself in a difficult position, profiting from elephant attractions while the species faces potential local extinction. Some tourism operators have begun advocating for more sustainable practices and supporting conservation initiatives, recognizing that their long term business viability depends on healthy elephant populations.

Economic Implications and Future Outlook

The economic implications of the elephant crisis extend far beyond conservation concerns. The potential collapse of elephant populations could severely impact Sri Lanka's tourism industry, which relies heavily on wildlife attractions to differentiate itself in the competitive South Asian tourism market.

Tourism revenue generated from elephant related activities supports thousands of jobs in rural areas, from safari guides and park rangers to hotel staff and local artisans. The loss of this economic engine would devastate communities that have few alternative income sources, potentially creating even greater pressure on natural resources.

The Path Forward: Balancing Conservation and Tourism

Addressing Sri Lanka's elephant crisis requires a fundamental shift in how the relationship between elephants, tourism, and local communities is managed. This includes,

Strengthening Legal Protections: Enforcing existing wildlife protection laws more effectively and implementing stricter penalties for elephant killing, while simultaneously addressing the root causes that drive people to harm elephants.

Expanding Compensation and Support Systems: Developing more comprehensive and accessible compensation schemes for crop damage, combined with support for alternative agricultural practices that are less attractive to elephants.

Tourism Revenue Sharing: Establishing mechanisms to ensure that a greater proportion of tourism revenue flows directly to local communities affected by human elephant conflict, creating economic incentives for conservation.

Education and Awareness: Promoting greater awareness among both local communities and tourists about the importance of elephant conservation and the actions needed to ensure coexistence.

The story of elephants and tourism in Sri Lanka stands at a critical crossroads. The choices made in the coming years will determine whether these magnificent creatures continue to enchant visitors and support local livelihoods, or whether they become merely a memory in a land that once celebrated them as gentle giants. The escalating elephant deaths serve as a stark warning that without immediate, comprehensive action, one of Sri Lanka's greatest tourism assets may be lost forever, taking with it not only a keystone species but also the sustainable tourism future that depends on their survival.

Success in addressing this crisis will require unprecedented cooperation between government agencies, tourism operators, conservation organizations, and local communities. Only through such collaborative efforts can Sri Lanka hope to preserve its elephants while maintaining a thriving, sustainable tourism industry that benefits both wildlife and people. The time for action is now, as each passing day brings the irreversible loss of these irreplaceable giants and the tourism dreams they inspire.

Main last departure airports and airlines to Sri Lanka,

July 2025

Analysis of departure airports for tourists to Sri Lanka in July reveals the strategic importance of major international aviation hubs in facilitating connectivity to the island nation. Middle Eastern airports emerge as the primary gateways, with Dubai leading at 14.50%, followed by Doha at 12.70% and Abu Dhabi at 8.78%. Combined, these three hubs handle more than one third of all tourist departures, demonstrating the pivotal role of Gulf carriers, Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad in linking Sri Lanka to global markets across Europe, North America, and Africa.

Indian airports represent the second largest departure cluster, collectively managing over 22% of outbound traffic. Chennai tops the Indian gateways at 7.53%, with Delhi (4.67%), Mumbai (4.40%), Bangalore (3.38%), and Hyderabad (2.04%) following as significant departure points. This pattern confirms India's dual role as both a primary tourist source and a crucial transit corridor for travelers from other countries accessing Sri Lanka.

Asian regional hubs demonstrate moderate but meaningful connectivity levels, with Singapore accounting for 3.85% and Kuala Lumpur for 3.61% of departures. Additional Asian gateways including Bangkok (1.87%), Shanghai (1.73%), and Hong Kong (1.64%) illustrate Sri Lanka's growing integration with broader Asian travel networks and the region's increasing significance in tourism flows.

European connectivity appears more limited, with London representing 2.97% of departures, while Frankfurt (1.22%) and Paris (1.07%) show smaller shares. These relatively modest figures suggest that European tourists continue to rely heavily on Middle Eastern transit hubs rather than direct European connections. Additional noteworthy departure points include Istanbul (3.38%) and Sharjah (3.88%), further reinforcing the dominance of Middle Eastern aviation infrastructure. Long haul destinations like Melbourne (1.40%) and Narita (0.77%) likely reflect diaspora connections and specialized tourism segments from Australia and Japan.

These findings suggest Sri Lanka should prioritize strengthening partnerships with Middle Eastern and Indian airlines while simultaneously pursuing expanded direct flight connectivity to reduce transit dependency. Developing regional tourism circuits through Southeast Asian hubs like Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, combined with continued investment in aviation infrastructure and route expansion, could significantly improve tourist accessibility and drive sector growth. Sri Lankan Airlines emerges as the dominant force in July's tourist arrivals, commanding over a quarter (25.43%) of all traffic with 50,916 passengers. This underscores its critical role as the national carrier in facilitating tourism. Gulf based airlines collectively form the second largest bloc, contributing 40.6% of arrivals through Emirates (12.32%), Qatar Airways (12.21%), Etihad Airways (7.84%), Fly Dubai (4.41%), and Air Arabia (3.82%). Their strong performance highlights Sri Lanka's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern transit hubs for tourist connectivity.

Regional airlines also play significant roles, particularly in key source markets. Indian carriers IndiGo (9.97%) and Air India (4.80%) together account for 14.77% of arrivals, reflecting robust tourist flows from India. East Asian connectivity is served by China Eastern Airlines (2.53%), Singapore Airlines (2.17%), and Air China (0.68%), though their collective share (5.38%) suggests room for growth in these markets. European and long haul traffic is facilitated by Turkish Airlines (3.38%) and Cathay Pacific (1.64%), while niche players like Fits Air (1.19%) and AirAsia (1.73%) cater to specialized segments.

This dependency pattern where 65% of tourists arrive via Sri Lankan Airlines or Gulf carriers presents both stability risks and diversification opportunities. The minimal presence of European and American airlines indicates potential to develop direct long haul routes and reduce reliance on transit hubs for Western markets.

Top ten markets versus main last departure airports and Main airlines to Sri Lanka July 2025

An analysis of airline preferences by source market reveals that Sri Lankan Airlines maintains strong market leadership in traditional Commonwealth and regional markets, securing dominant positions in Australia (54.49%), Canada (41.82%), and India (36.23%). Gulf carriers have achieved collective dominance across European markets, controlling approximately 70% of passenger traffic from the UK, Netherlands, and Germany. Qatar Airways demonstrates particular strength in the Spanish market with 28.64% share. However, the UK market presents a unique competitive landscape where market share is relatively balanced among three major carriers: Sri Lankan Airlines (26.49%), Emirates (21.99%), and Qatar Airways (22.26%).

Chinese travelers show strong preference for domestic carriers, with China Eastern commanding 33.15% and Air China holding 10.08% of the market. In addition, Sri Lankan Airlines (15.93%) and Cathay Pacific (15.11%) are the other key airlines used by Chinese tourists. Meanwhile, Australian passengers predominantly choose Sri Lankan Airlines (54.49%) alongside Singapore Airlines (23.25%) as their preferred carriers.

The United States market exhibits significant fragmentation, with no single carrier achieving clear dominance. Qatar Airways leads with 20.51%, closely followed by Sri Lankan Airlines at 20.20%, while Emirates captures 8.66% and IndiGo secures 10.90%, creating a highly competitive environment across multiple carriers.

These patterns reveal distinct regional preferences and strategic dependencies. European travelers demonstrate overwhelming reliance on Gulf hub connectivity for reaching Sri Lanka, while other markets favour either direct services (such as Sri Lankan's routes to Australia and Canada) or regional low-cost carriers (like IndiGo's strong Indian market presence).

Sri Lanka's tourism connectivity relies heavily on regional transit hubs, with clear geographic patterns emerging. For European travelers (UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain), Gulf airports dominate as transit points: Dubai, Doha, and Abu Dhabi collectively account for 52-66%, underscoring their role as critical gateways for long haul traffic. Conversely, Indian tourists arrive primarily via direct flights from domestic airports, with Chennai (33%), Bangalore (15%), Delhi (12%), Mumbai (13%), and Hyderabad (10%) together representing 83% of departures demonstrating minimal reliance on intermediate hubs. Australians depend significantly on Southeast Asian connections, with Singapore (33%) and Melbourne (27%) as primary departure points, while Chinese tourists depart overwhelmingly from Shanghai (23%) and Hong Kong (15%). The U.S. market shows fragmented routing, using Singapore (12%), Hong Kong (4%), and Gulf hubs (Dubai 9%, Doha 21%, Abu Dhabi 12%). Secondary hubs like Istanbul serve niche roles for French (12%) and Dutch (6.2%) travelers, and London functions primarily for UK originating tourists (20% direct).

This hub centric model reveals strategic dependencies: Gulf airports anchor European/North American connectivity, Southeast Asian hubs (Singapore, Bangkok) facilitate Asia Pacific traffic, and direct flights dominate short haul markets (India). Opportunities exist to diversify routes particularly direct European connections.
