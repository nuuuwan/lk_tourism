Summary

Sri Lanka commenced 2025 with a remarkable influx of 252,761 tourists in January, marking the highest number of arrivals ever recorded for this month. This figure represents a 21.4% increase compared to January 2024 and a 5.8% rise over January 2018, which was previously considered the peak year for the nation's tourism industry. Enhanced air connectivity, the revival of cruise tourism, and strengthened bilateral relations could be some of the pivotal factors contributing to this growth momentum.

The significant rise in tourist arrivals from source markets like India, Russia, the UK, China, and Germany has been pivotal in revitalizing Sri Lanka's tourism sector.

According to UNWTO, in 2024, international tourism rebounded significantly, with approximately 1.4 billion tourists traveling globally, marking an 11% increase from 2023 and nearly reaching pre-pandemic levels.

This resurgence was fueled by strong post-pandemic demand, robust performance from major source markets, and the ongoing recovery of destinations in Asia and the Pacific. Enhanced air connectivity and improved visa facilitation also supported international travel. Looking ahead, international tourist arrivals are projected to grow by 3% to 5% in 2025 compared to 2024, though economic and geopolitical challenges continue to pose significant risks (UNWTO, 2025

A Glimpse into tourists visiting Sri Lanka: trends and highlights

Collecting feedback from departing foreign tourists is essential for understanding visitor experiences and enhancing tourism services. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) conducts annual surveys targeting international tourists departing from the country. These surveys aim to build detailed profiles of departing tourists, enrich tourism statistics with both qualitative and quantitative data, identify factors influencing tourist arrivals, and provide information for strategic decision-making by public and private sectors.

To facilitate the collection of this valuable feedback, QR codes have been implemented at key points such as Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and Jaffna Airport. By scanning these codes, departing tourists can easily access online surveys and provide their insights. This method streamlines the feedback process, making it more convenient for travelers to share their experiences. The data collected through these QR code-enabled surveys is instrumental in informing decisions related to tourism planning, promotion, and marketing, ultimately contributing to the sustainable development of Sri Lanka's tourism industry.

Sri Lanka's tourism sector has observed distinct patterns in visitor demographics, travel preferences, and favoured destinations. Understanding these trends is crucial for stakeholders aiming to enhance the country's appeal to international tourists.

Age and Gender Demographics

A significant portion of tourists visiting Sri Lanka fall within the 24-35 followed by 35- 44 age group. This

youthful demographic indicates Sri Lanka's appeal to younger travelers seeking diverse experiences. As per the findings of survey conducted by Travo Trip, Millennials and Gen Z are leading the charge, making up 84% of respondents and driving trends with their appetite for exploration, community, and meaningful experiences. This global trend resonates with the findings of this survey. Contrary to the global trend where female travelers often outnumber male’s majority of travelers worldwide are female (Trova trip, 2025), Sri Lanka sees a higher number of male tourists. This deviation suggests unique factors influencing male travel to the country, warranting further research to tailor marketing strategies effectively.

Travel Companions and Duration

Family travel is the most prevalent mode of visitation to Sri Lanka, with individual travel following closely. The surge in family travel could be likely due to the influx of Indian, British and German tourists travelling with their families. This is in line with the global trends, in Sri Lanka also. Solo travel is booming, as more individuals embrace the freedom to explore on their own terms. The typical stay for tourists ranges from one to two weeks, allowing ample time to explore the nation's rich cultural heritage, natural beauty, and historical sites. As per the study conducted by the TrovaTrip travelers are prioritizing trips that last 7–10 days, balancing immersion with convenience. 2025 travel insights show that experiences are king, with food and beverage tours, beach relaxation, cultural exploration, and outdoor adventures topping wish lists.

Information Sources Influencing Travel Decisions

Tourists primarily gather information about Sri Lanka through friends and relatives, online platforms, and digital advertising. The influence of personal networks underscores the importance of positive word-of-mouth, while the reliance on online sources highlights the need for a robust digital presence to attract potential visitors.

Travel Arrangements and Purpose

A majority of tourists prefer non-package tours, opting for personalized travel experiences. The primary

motivation for visiting Sri Lanka is holiday or leisure, indicating the country's strong positioning as a destination for relaxation and recreation.

The five most popular destinations among tourists are Ella, Galle, Sigiriya Rock Fortress, Nuwara Eliya and Temple of the Tooth, Kandy. These destinations highlight the country's rich cultural heritage, natural beauty, and historical significance, making them must-visit spots for travelers.

While the above were the travel patterns for 2024 in Sri Lanka, it is vital to look forward to the future travel patterns that will shape the tourism industry in 2025. Understanding these tourism trends is essential for stakeholders aiming to enhance Sri Lanka's appeal and ensure sustainable growth in the sector.

Travel trends for 2025

Amadeus, a leading travel technology company and BBC has identified several key travel trends set to shape the industry in 2025:

New Heydays

Travelers are increasingly seeking experiences that evoke nostalgia, revisiting destinations from their youth or reliving significant life events such as honeymoons and gap years. This trend reflects a desire to reconnect with simpler times and cherished memories.

Personalized Flying

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), 5G connectivity, and virtual reality (VR) are enabling airlines to offer highly personalized and immersive in-flight experiences. Passengers can expect tailored content and services that cater to their individual preferences, enhancing the overall journey

Trailblazer Hotels

Hotels are evolving into destinations themselves, offering unique identities and immersive experiences that reflect their surroundings. Travelers are drawn to properties that provide a strong sense of place, often planning their trips around these distinctive accommodations.

Asia Uplift

Asia is experiencing a resurgence in travel, with countries implementing visa -free programs and other initiatives to attract visitors.

Connections In Real Life (IRL)

As digital fatigue sets in, travelers are seeking genuine, face-to-face interactions during their journeys. This trend includes solo travelers looking to make new friends and individuals interested in forming real-world connections, moving away from online interactions. These trends highlight a shift towards personalized, meaningful, and immersive travel experiences, reflecting travelers' desires to connect deeply with destinations and people.
