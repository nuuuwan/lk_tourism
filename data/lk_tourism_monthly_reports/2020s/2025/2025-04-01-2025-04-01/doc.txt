Summary

Sri Lanka’s tourism sector is demonstrating strong momentum in early 2025, with January to April figures indicating substantial year-on-year growth. The monthly tourist arrivals data for Sri Lanka shows a strong upward trend in the first four months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. In January 2025, arrivals rose to 252,761, marking a 21.4% increase from January 2024. February saw 240,217 arrivals, up 10% from the previous year, while March recorded 229,298 arrivals, a 9.62% rise. April 2025 arrivals reached 174,608, representing a 17.3% increase over April 2024.

This strong growth at the start of the year suggests a robust recovery or expansion in the tourism sector, likely driven by improved global travel conditions, and greater international confidence in Sri Lanka as a destination.

Major source markets such as India, the United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, and Australia played a pivotal role in boosting Sri Lanka’s tourism sector in April. These countries made significant contributions to the surge in visitor arrivals, providing vital support and driving the overall growth in the industry during this period.

1,222 Europe is the largest source region, contributing 83,730 arrivals, which accounts for 48% of the total. The Asia & Pacific region follows closely with 78,878 arrivals, making up 45.2%. Together, these two regions represent the overwhelming majority of Sri Lanka’s inbound tourists, highlighting the country’s strong appeal to both Western and regional travelers. The Americas contributed 8,079 arrivals (4.6%), while the Middle East and Africa accounted for only 2,619 (1.4%) and 1,302 (0.7%) arrivals, respectively. This indicates that Sri Lanka’s tourism sector is much less dependent on these regions, and there may be untapped potential for growth.

The high numbers from Europe may be attributed to seasonal travel patterns, cultural interests, and favourable travel packages, while proximity and ease of travel likely drive arrivals from the Asia & Pacific region. The relatively low figures from the Middle East and Africa may reflect limited direct flights, or less targeted marketing.

The heavy reliance on Europe and Asia & Pacific suggests that Sri Lanka’s marketing and connectivity are strongest in these regions. However, this also means the industry is vulnerable to economic or political changes in these markets. Diversifying source markets-especially by increasing promotion and improving air links with the Americas, Middle East, and Africa-could help stabilize and grow overall tourist arrivals. Tailored marketing campaigns, improved flight connectivity, and targeted travel incentives could help attract more visitors from these underrepresented regions.

Top ten source markets

April 2025

Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka from its top ten source markets in April 2025 reveals notable changes compared to April 2024. India remains the leading source, with arrivals increasing significantly from 27,304 to 38,744, reflecting a 41.9% growth. The United Kingdom also showed a strong rise, up 31.7% to 17,348 visitors. Germany, Australia, Bangladesh, and the Netherlands all recorded substantial increases, with Bangladesh more than doubling its arrivals from 2,354 to 5,428, indicating growing regional interest and possibly improved connectivity or promotions. In contrast, arrivals from Russia declined by 10.5%, likely due to geopolitical or economic factors affecting outbound travel. China and France saw slight decreases, while the United States experienced a notable drop of 24.6%, which could be attributed to long-haul travel hesitancy, economic conditions, or competition from other destinations. Overall, the variations in arrivals can be linked to factors such as enhanced air and sea connectivity, successful marketing campaigns, regional proximity, economic conditions in source countries, and global travel trends, all influencing the flow of tourists to Sri Lanka.

The vast majority of tourists still arrive by air, which is expected due to Sri Lanka’s Island geography and the convenience of international flights. However, arrivals by sea, while a smaller proportion, are not insignificant for certain markets. For example, India saw 540 arrivals by sea, the highest among all countries, followed by the United States (339), Australia (88), the United Kingdom (55), and the Netherlands (24). This suggests that cruise tourism and ferry connections, especially with nearby countries like India, are contributing to the overall tourism numbers and have room for further development.

Top ten source markets

January to April 2025

Sri Lanka’s tourism sector continues to display robust and diverse growth across its major source markets in the first four months of 2025. India remains the clear leader, with 157,059 arrivals-an impressive 27.1% year-over-year increase from 123,583 in the same period of 2024. This growth is driven by geographic proximity, cultural ties, and improved connectivity, further supported by a notable number of arrivals by sea, indicating the potential for maritime tourism expansion. Russia sustains its position as the second-largest source market, with 107,093 visitors, reflecting steady performance and a marginal 0.7% increase. This suggests a stable demand, possibly influenced by consistent flight connections and established travel patterns. European markets present a dynamic picture. The United Kingdom saw arrivals rise from 71,992 to 87,053 (21.0% growth), while Germany increased from 58,019 to 61,855 (6.6%). France and the Netherlands stand out with strong growth rates of 22.5% and 36.4% respectively, likely benefiting from favourable economic conditions, targeted marketing, and enhanced air links. Australia also posted a significant 31.5% increase, with arrivals reaching 38,309, underscoring Sri Lanka’s appeal to long-haul travelers including expatriats. China, however, recorded a 6.7% decline in arrivals (from 51,612 to 48,180), highlighting ongoing recovery challenges, possible travel restrictions, or increased competition from other Asian destinations. In contrast, the United States and Poland showed promising growth of 2.8% and 9.2% respectively, signaling emerging opportunities in these markets. The country benefits from strong performances in its traditional markets while also seeing encouraging signs from emerging regions. However, the decline from China signals the need for renewed engagement and tailored strategies to regain momentum in that important market.

Tourist arrivals by purpose of visit

April 2025

Leisure tourism remains the dominant purpose of travel to Sri Lanka, accounting for 57% of all international arrivals. This underscores the country’s strong appeal as a holiday destination, owing to its scenic beaches, rich cultural heritage, and natural attractions. Travel to visit friends and relatives constitutes 8.35% of arrivals, highlighting the role of the Sri Lankan diaspora and family ties in driving inbound travel. Meanwhile, the MICE segment (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) makes up 6.15%, reflecting a significant presence of business-related tourism—a potentially high-value market for the hospitality industry. Smaller segments include business travel (2%), health and Ayurvedic tourism (0.6%), religious tourism (0.5%), sports tourism (0.5%), education-related travel (0.06%), and official visits (0.001%). While these non-leisure segments represent a smaller share, they point to a diverse range of motivations drawing visitors to the country. Chart 4: Purpose of visit

Travel for religious, sports, education, and official purposes remains marginal across all markets, generally below 1%. Overall, the data underscores the dominance of leisure tourism, the importance of diaspora ties for visiting friends and relatives, and varying levels of business and MICE travel across different source market.

Top ten markets versus main last departure airports and Main airlines to Sri Lanka April 2025

A detailed breakdown of airline preferences among tourists from Sri Lanka’s top source markets, reveals distinct patterns based on geographic proximity, airline connectivity, and market-specific factors. For Indian travelers, IndiGo is the most preferred carrier, accounting for 42.71% of arrivals, closely followed by Sri Lankan Airlines at 38.79%. Air India also holds a significant share (13.69%), underscoring the dominance of Indian and Sri Lankan carriers in facilitating travel between the two countries. This heavy reliance on regional airlines reflects the high frequency of direct flights and the strong bilateral connectivity between India and Sri Lanka. Tourists from the United Kingdom show a more diversified airline preference. Sri Lankan Airlines leads with 32.92%, but Middle Eastern carriers such as Qatar Airways (17.24%), Emirates (17.92%), and Etihad Airways (10.30%) collectively account for a substantial portion, highlighting the importance of Gulf transit hubs. This pattern is similarly observed among German, French, and Dutch travelers, where Sri Lankan Airlines remains a key player, but Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad Airways also command significant shares due to their extensive European networks and convenient connections. The Russian market exhibits a unique trend, with Red Wings Airlines (37.25%) and Aeroflot (21.93%) dominating, indicating a strong preference for direct services from Russian carriers. Sri Lankan Airlines and Middle Eastern airlines play a much smaller role for Russian tourists. For Australian visitors, Sri Lankan Airlines is the overwhelming favorite (51.47%), followed by Singapore Airlines (21.3%) reflecting the limited direct options and the reliance on Singapore for long-haul travel. Meanwhile, travelers from China display a more fragmented pattern, with China Eastern Airlines (36.83%) leading, followed by Cathey pacific(16.5%) indicating the importance of both direct and regional connections. Bangladeshi tourists overwhelmingly favour Sri Lankan Airlines (45.91%) and Fits Air (26.9%), mirroring the trend seen in the Indian market, while the United States market is more dispersed, with Sri Lankan Airlines (20.35%), Qatar Airways (20.49%), and a significant “Others” category (13.23%) reflecting the variety of possible routes and stopovers for long-haul travel. Overall, the data highlights Sri Lankan Airlines’ strong presence across most markets, especially in regional and long-haul segments. Middle Eastern carriers (Qatar Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Fly Dubai, and Air Arabia) collectively play a pivotal role in connecting Europe, Australia, and the US to Sri Lanka, leveraging their strategic hub locations. The dominance of national and regional carriers in markets like India, Bangladesh, Russia, and China underscores the importance of direct connectivity and market-specific airline partnerships in shaping travel preferences to Sri Lanka.

Table 4. Top ten markets vs. main airlines to Sri Lanka, April

Table 5. Top ten markets vs. main last departure airports to Sri Lanka, April

An analysis of last departure airports among Sri Lanka’s key source markets reveals distinct connectivity patterns that shape inbound tourism. India, the leading contributor with 38,744 arrivals, relies heavily on direct regional routes, as Chennai (11,816), Bangalore (8,437), and Mumbai (6,816) together account for nearly two-thirds of Indian visitors. This underscores the dominance of short-haul, direct connections for the Indian market, facilitating ease of travel and high volumes.

In contrast, Russian travelers (13,525 arrivals) predominantly depart via Moscow (4,028), but also utilize Middle Eastern hubs like Sharjah (2,062) and Abu Dhabi (1,597), reflecting limited direct connectivity and a reliance on charter services or Gulf carriers. European source markets, such as

the United Kingdom (17,348 arrivals) and Germany (11,654 arrivals), demonstrate a strong dependence on Middle Eastern transit points. British and German tourists frequently route through Dubai (3,292 and 2,541, respectively), Doha (3,010 and 2,137), and Abu Dhabi, while London remains a significant direct gateway for the UK (4,219).

French travelers (8,276 arrivals) also favour Doha (1,717) and Abu Dhabi (1,344) as transit points. Chinese visitors (8,667 arrivals) utilize both direct flights from Shanghai (2,274) and regional Southeast Asian hubs like Hong Kong (1,433) and Kuala Lumpur (498), indicating the importance of these transit points for connectivity. Australian travelers (10,744 arrivals) show a distinctive preference for Singapore (3,211) and Melbourne (2,573) as departure points, while American visitors (4,202 arrivals) are more dispersed across multiple hubs, with no single dominant airport.

These trends highlight a clear divide: regional short-haul markets like India benefit from direct connections, while long-haul markets-especially in Europe and Russia-depend on Gulf and Southeast Asian transit hubs. The strategic importance of airports in Dubai, Doha, and Singapore is evident, suggesting that optimizing partnerships and connectivity through these hubs could further enhance Sri Lanka’s appeal to long-haul travelers. Additionally, the reliance on unconventional routes and specialized transit points may represent opportunities for targeted marketing and route development to capture niche tourism segments.
