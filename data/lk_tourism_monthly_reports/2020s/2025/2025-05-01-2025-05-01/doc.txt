Their significant contributions have been instrumental in driving the surge in visitor arrivals and supporting the overall growth of the industry throughout this period.

3,355 An analysis of tourist arrivals by region in May 2025 highlights the primary geographical sources of visitors to Sri Lanka. The Asia & Pacific region stands out as the largest contributor, accounting for 82,342 arrivals, which represents a significant 61.9% of the total. This dominance underscores the strong regional connectivity and perhaps shorter travel distances and cultural affinities that make Sri Lanka a highly accessible and attractive destination for travelers from this vast region.

Europe follows as the second-largest source region, contributing 40,108 arrivals, making up 30.1% of the total. Together, Asia & Pacific and Europe collectively represent the overwhelming majority of Sri Lanka's inbound tourists, emphasizing the country's strong appeal and established tourism infrastructure catering to both Western and regional travelers.

The Americas contributed 7,544 arrivals (5.6%), while the Middle East and Africa accounted for comparatively smaller shares, with 1,953 arrivals (1.5%) and 972 arrivals (0.7%) respectively. This regional distribution indicates that Sri Lanka’s tourism sector is currently much less reliant on these latter regions for overall volume, suggesting substantial untapped potential for growth.

The consistently high numbers from Asia & Pacific and Europe can be attributed to a combination of factors, including established travel patterns, extensive flight connectivity, cultural interests, and favorable travel packages. Conversely, the relatively low figures from the Middle East and Africa may reflect limitations such as fewer direct flight options, less targeted marketing efforts, or a lower awareness of Sri Lanka as a leisure destination within these regions. This heavy reliance on Europe and Asia & Pacific implies that while marketing and connectivity are strongest in these areas, the industry remains somewhat vulnerable to economic or political shifts within these key markets. Diversifying source markets, particularly by increasing promotional activities and improving air links with the Americas, Middle East, and Africa, could significantly help stabilize and foster overall tourist arrivals. Tailored marketing campaigns, enhanced flight connectivity, and targeted travel incentives could be instrumental in attracting more visitors from these underrepresented regions.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report May 2025

Top ten source markets

May 2025

An analysis of key source markets reveals that India stands as the undisputed leader, contributing a dominant 35.4% of total arrivals. This signifies an exceptionally strong and consistent inbound flow, likely driven by geographical proximity, cultural ties, and robust air connectivity. While this provides a strong foundation for Sri Lanka's tourism, such heavy reliance on a single market also presents a vulnerability; any significant negative shifts in Indian outbound travel could disproportionately impact overall arrivals.

Following India, the market share distribution becomes more fragmented. The United Kingdom (6.9%) and China (6.6%) are the next significant contributors, collectively accounting for around 13.5% of arrivals.

Bangladesh (5.5%), Germany (5.4%), and Australia (4.5%) form a mid-tier group of contributors. The consistent presence of Germany indicates a mature European market, often associated with higher-spending tourists and specialized interests (as seen in the "Health/Ayurvedic" purpose). Bangladesh's strong showing points to robust regional connections and perhaps a growing outbound travel market. Australia, as a long-haul market, signifies successful efforts in attracting visitors especially for VFR purposes despite the greater distance.

Further down the list, France (4.1%), the United States (2.7%), Canada (2.6%), and Russia (2.5%) represent smaller, but still important, segments. The European markets (France, Germany) highlight continued interest from traditional Western sources, while the Americas (US, Canada) represent markets with significant untapped potential, often associated with higher average spending. Russia's presence, while smaller, indicates the success of specific initiatives or direct flight connections from this market.

Understanding the unique characteristics and travel behaviors of each of these markets, is paramount for developing effective, tailored tourism strategies.

Top ten source markets

January to May 2025

Sri Lanka’s tourism sector is demonstrating robust and diverse growth across its major source markets in the first five months of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. India remains the clear leader, with 204,060 arrivals in Jan-May 2025, an impressive 30.94% year-over-year increase from 155,837 in the same period of 2024. This substantial growth is driven by geographic proximity, strong cultural ties, and improved connectivity. The Russian Federation sustained its position as the second-largest source market, with 110,421 visitors in Jan-May 2025. However, this represents a slight decline of 0.24% from 110,692 in Jan-May 2024. This indicates a relatively stable, but not growing, demand, possibly influenced by consistent flight connections and established travel patterns. European markets present a dynamic picture. The United Kingdom saw arrivals rise significantly from 80,086 in Jan-May 2024 to 96,274 in Jan-May 2025, a robust 20.21% growth. Germany also experienced an increase from 65,514 to 69,078, marking a 5.44% growth. France stands out with particularly strong growth, rising from 46,238 to 57,112 arrivals, a 23.52% increase. Similarly, Poland recorded a promising 9.15% increase, from 22,849 to 24,941 arrivals. These positive trends from European markets likely benefit from favorable economic conditions, targeted marketing, and enhanced air links. Australia also posted a significant 27.87% increase, with arrivals reaching 44,026 in Jan-May 2025, up from 34,429 in Jan-May 2024, underscoring Sri Lanka’s appeal to long-haul travelers including expatriates. China, however, recorded a 4.30% decline in arrivals, falling from 59,542 in Jan-May 2024 to 56,983 in Jan-May 2025. This highlights ongoing recovery challenges and increased competition from other Asian destinations, signaling a need for renewed engagement and tailored strategies to regain momentum in this important market. In contrast, the United States showed modest growth of 1.03%, with arrivals increasing from 28,694 to 28,991, signaling emerging opportunities in this market that could be further cultivated. A notable highlight is Bangladesh, which experienced an exceptional 142.59% surge in arrivals, growing from 11,258 in Jan-May 2024 to 27,311 in Jan-May 2025, indicating a rapidly emerging and significant market. Overall, Sri Lanka's tourism sector benefits from strong performances in its traditional markets, particularly India and several European nations, while also seeing encouraging signs from emerging regions like Bangladesh and Australia. However, the decline from Russia and China signals the need for renewed engagement and tailored strategies to regain momentum and address specific challenges in those markets. Continued diversification of source markets, improved air links, and targeted promotions will be key to sustaining and accelerating overall tourist arrivals.

Tourist arrivals by purpose of visit

May 2025

The analysis of tourist arrivals for May 2025 reveals that 'Pleasure/Vacation' continues to be the predominant purpose of visit, constituting a substantial majority of all inbound tourists (51%). This consistently high proportion reaffirms Sri Lanka's strong market positioning as a leisure destination. Complementing the leisure segment, 'Visiting Friends and Relatives' and 'MICE' (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) represent key secondary purposes, contributing 8.35% and 6.15% respectively. These segments underscore the importance of diaspora engagement and the growing potential of business tourism. Smaller, yet strategically important, niche categories such as 'Business' (3%), 'Sports' (0.6%), and 'Health/Ayurvedic' (0.5%) also contribute to the visitor profile, indicating opportunities for focused development within specialized tourism sectors.

Chart 5: Purpose of visit vs main source markets

A deeper dive into the purpose of visit by top source markets for May 2025 reveals

interesting market-specific dynamics. While 'Pleasure/Vacation' is generally dominant, its

proportion varies significantly, ranging from a high of 69.40% for France to a low of

22.95% for Canada and 26.62% for the Russian Federation. This highlights diverse

market preferences, with some nations strongly prioritizing leisure travel. Conversely, the

'Visiting Friends and Relatives' segment is exceptionally high for Canada (65.12%), and

notably strong for the United Kingdom (31.38%) Australia (33.24%) and United Sates

(25.84%) indicating robust community ties. The 'MICE' segment shows particular strength

from the Russian Federation (9.59%) and France (7.93%), suggesting these markets are

key for business-related travel and events. 'Health/Ayurvedic' purpose stands out for

Germany (4.18%), indicating a specialized interest from this market. These market-

specific trends emphasize the necessity of tailored marketing and product development

strategies to effectively capture and serve the distinct motivations of tourists from each

key source country.
