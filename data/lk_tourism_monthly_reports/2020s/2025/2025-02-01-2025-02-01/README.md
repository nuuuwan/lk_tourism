Summary

Bolstered by peak tourism season momentum and beneficial local and international conditions, Sri Lanka's tourism sector saw substantial growth in February 2025. International tourist arrivals reached 240,217, a 10.01% increase compared to February of the previous year, contributing to the revitalization of the industry. Collectively, the first two months of 2025 welcomed 492,978 visitors, marking the highest-ever arrivals for these months. This consistent growth highlights Sri Lanka's appeal as a preferred travel destination.

Key source markets such as India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France significantly boosted Sri Lanka's tourism in February. Their contributions were instrumental in driving the increase in tourist arrivals, providing vital support to the

nation's tourism industry. According to the UNWTO, international tourism experienced a significant rebound in 2024, with around 1.4 billion tourists traveling worldwide. This represents an 11% increase compared to 2023, bringing global tourism close to pre-pandemic levels. The recovery was driven by strong post-pandemic demand, solid performance from key source markets, and the continued revival of destinations in Asia and the Pacific. Improved air connectivity and easier visa processes further supported international travel. Looking forward, international tourist arrivals are expected to grow by 3% to 5% in 2025 compared to 2024, although economic and geopolitical challenges remain significant risks.

Top ten source markets

February 2025

In February, India stood out as the leading source market for tourists traveling to Sri Lanka, representing 14.9% of total arrivals. The Russian Federation followed closely at 12.6%, while the United Kingdom and Germany contributed 10.6% and 7.2%, respectively, and France accounted for 6.4%. These figures highlight shifting travel patterns, with a notable rise in visitors from emerging markets like Poland and Netherland, alongside steady contributions from traditional markets such as Germany, compared to the previous year. It is noteworthy that tourist arrivals from Russia and China have declined. This shift may be attributed to various factors, including changing economic conditions, geopolitical issues, or evolving travel preferences among tourists from these countries

Additionally, the rise in visitors from emerging markets like Poland and Netherland may reflect increasing disposable incomes and a growing appetite for international travel in these regions, while the sustained performance of traditional markets underscores Sri Lanka's enduring appeal among established tourist demographics.

Top ten source markets

January to February 2025

Between January and February 2025, Sri Lanka witnessed a significant surge in tourist arrivals from India, the Russian Federation, the UK, Germany, and China, establishing these countries as the top five international visitor markets. Notably, there was also considerable growth in visitors from Australia and the Netherlands, highlighting Sri Lanka's increasing appeal in these regions. However, the decline in Chinese tourists is noteworthy. This combination of growth and decline underscores the importance for Sri Lanka to diversify its tourism markets, thereby enhancing resilience and fostering a sustainable tourism approach in a changing travel climate. By expanding its reach to emerging and diverse markets, Sri Lanka can better navigate regional disruptions and build a stronger foundation for sustained growth in its tourism sector.

Business-related travel accounts for 2% of visits, suggesting that Sri Lanka is gradually emerging as a destination for professional engagements. While this is a smaller segment, it has potential for growth, particularly with the rise of remote work and global business collaborations. Health tourism, including Ayurveda and wellness, makes up 1% of visits. This niche segment reflects Sri Lanka’s growing reputation as a destination for holistic health and wellness. With targeted marketing and infrastructure development, this segment could expand further, especially among travelers seeking alternative and traditional healing practices. MICE tourism (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) represents 7% of visits, indicating a growing interest in Sri Lanka as a destination for corporate and large-scale events. This segment is promising, as it typically involves high-spending travelers and can boost the hospitality and event management sectors. Sports tourism accounts for 0.43% of visits, a relatively small but emerging segment. Sri Lanka’s potential for adventure sports, cricket, and other activities could be further developed to attract sports enthusiasts and event organizers.

The Best Choice for Sri Lanka as a Destination

Package vs. Non-Package Tourists:

Sri Lanka, with its rich cultural heritage, stunning landscapes, and diverse experiences, has long been a sought-after destination for international travelers. As the country continues to rebuild and reposition itself in the global tourism market, a critical question arises: Are package tourists or non-package tourists the best choice for Sri Lanka as a destination? To answer this, it is essential to analyze the impact of both types of travelers from the perspective of Sri Lanka’s economic, social, and environmental sustainability. A recent ongoing survey involving 5,536 inbound tourists to Sri Lanka revealed that 40% traveled as package tourists, while 60% were free independent travelers (FITs). This trend towards independent travel is influenced by advancements in technology, including artificial intelligence, and the availability of diverse booking platforms catering to the preferences of modern travelers, particularly younger demographics. Notably, tourists from countries such as India, China, Poland, and Russia are more inclined to opt for package tours. The operation of charter flights to Sri Lanka during specific seasons by airlines like Red Wings, Enter Air, Air Astana, Air Seychelles, and Bulgarian Airlines etc. Further supports this observation.

Package Tourists: Structured and Predictable

The history of package tours dates back to 1841 when Thomas Cook persuaded the Midland Counties Railway Company to run a special train between Leicester and Loughborough for a temperance meeting. By 1855 he was leading tours to the continent and by 1866 to the United States, with his first round-the-world tour following in 18 72. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a surge in the popularity of package tours. The advent of railways and steamships made travel more accessible and affordable. Companies began offering inclusive tours that combined transportation, accommodation, and activities, catering to the growing middle class's desire to explore new destinations. Over time, package tours have evolved significantly, adapting to changing traveler preferences and technological advancements. Despite these changes, they continue to thrive, offering diverse experiences to meet the varied interests of modern tourists.

Package tourists are those who book pre-arranged travel itineraries through tour operators or travel agencies. These packages typically include flights, accommodations, transportation, and guided tours, offering a hassle-free experience for travelers.

Advantages for Sri Lanka:

1. Economic Impact:

o Package tourists often spend more on high-end accommodations, guided tours, and curated

experiences, contributing significantly to the local economy.

o Their spending is more predictable and concentrated in specific areas, making it easier for

businesses to plan and optimize their services. 2. Ease of Management:

o Package tourists follow structured itineraries, which helps distribute tourist traffic across key

attractions and reduces overcrowding in popular areas. o This structure allows for better resource management and reduces the strain on local

infrastructure.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report February 2025

11

.

3. Promotion of Lesser-Known Destinations:

o Tour operators often include off-the-beaten-path destinations in their packages,

helping to promote underdeveloped regions and distribute economic benefits more evenly. 4. Higher Spending on Local Services:

o Package tourists are more likely to use local guides, drivers, and other services

included in their packages, directly supporting local livelihoods.

Challenges:

1. Limited Flexibility:

o Package tourists may have less freedom to explore independently, which can limit their

exposure to local culture and smaller businesses. 2. Environmental Impact:

o Concentrated tourist flows to popular destinations can lead to environmental degradation if

not managed sustainably.

Non-Package Tourists: Independent and Exploratory Except for few key markets such as India, China, Poland and Russia travelers to Sri Lanka are predominantly free independent travelers (FITs) Non-package tourists, often referred to as independent or backpacker travelers, plan their trips without pre-arranged itineraries. They tend to seek authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences and often stay longer in the country.

Advantages for Sri Lanka:

1. Economic Diversification:

o Independent travelers often spend money on local businesses, such as small guesthouses,

street food vendors, and local transport, spreading economic benefits more widely. o Their spending patterns support micro-entrepreneurs and informal sectors, which are crucial

for inclusive economic growth. 2. Cultural Exchange:

o Non-package tourists are more likely to engage with local communities, fostering cultural

exchange and promoting Sri Lanka’s rich heritage. o Their interactions often lead to positive word-of-mouth promotion, attracting like-minded

travelers. 3. Longer Stays:

o Independent travelers tend to stay longer in the country, contributing to sustained revenue

generation and reducing the seasonality of tourism.

4. Sustainability:

o Many independent travelers are environmentally conscious and seek eco-friendly

accommodations and experiences, aligning with Sri Lanka’s goals of promoting sustainable tourism.

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report February 2025

12

Challenges:

1. Unpredictable Spending:

o Independent travelers may have lower daily spending compared to package tourists, as

they often seek budget-friendly options. 2. Strain on Infrastructure:

o Their exploratory nature can lead to overcrowding in lesser-known areas, putting pressure

on local infrastructure and resources. 3. Safety and Management:

o Independent travelers may venture into remote or underdeveloped areas, requiring better

safety measures and infrastructure to support their needs.

Which is the Best Choice for Sri Lanka?

The answer lies in striking a balance between package and non-package tourists. Both types of travelers bring unique benefits and challenges, and Sri Lanka’s tourism strategy should aim to leverage the strengths of each while mitigating their drawbacks.

1. Targeting High-Value Package Tourists:

Sri Lanka should focus on attracting high-value package tourists who contribute significantly to the economy while ensuring that their itineraries include sustainable practices and support for local communities. 2. Encouraging Independent Travelers:

Independent travelers should be encouraged through targeted marketing campaigns that highlight Sri Lanka’s authenticity, cultural richness, and eco-friendly options. Improving infrastructure in lesser-known areas can help accommodate their exploratory nature. 3. Promoting Sustainable Tourism:

Both types of travelers should be encouraged to adopt sustainable practices, such as supporting eco-friendly accommodations, respecting local cultures, and minimizing environmental impact. 4. Diversifying Tourism Offerings: Sri Lanka should diversify its tourism offerings to cater to both package and non-package tourists. This includes developing niche markets such as adventure tourism, wellness tourism, and cultural tourism.

Conclusion

Sri Lanka’s tourism industry stands to benefit significantly from both package and non-package tourists. Package tourists bring structured, high-value contributions to the economy, while independent travelers foster cultural exchange and support local businesses. By adopting a balanced approach, Sri Lanka can maximize the benefits of both types of travelers while promoting sustainable and inclusive growth. The key lies in creating a diverse and resilient tourism ecosystem that caters to the needs of all travelers while preserving the country’s natural and cultural heritage for future generations.
