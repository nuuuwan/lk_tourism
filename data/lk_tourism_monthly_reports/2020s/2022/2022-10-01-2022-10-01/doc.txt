Europe became the largest source of

tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 50.8 % of the

total traffic received in October 2022,

especially from countries such as the

United Kingdom, Germany and France, is

likely to have driven this growth

momentum. Asia and the Pacific

accounted for 39.1 % of total arrivals. The

Americas accounted for 7.2 % of the total

traffic while the Middle East accounted for

2.3 %.

The gradual improvement in international

traveling was once again threatened by

external factors such as the Russian

invasion of Ukraine, coupled with the

related challenging economic environment,

and internal factors incliding on goung the

economic crisis .
