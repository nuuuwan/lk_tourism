Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during July 2022 was 47,293. Tourist arrivals for the month of July have plunged by almost 55.5%, in comparison to March 2022, which recorded the highest number of tourist arrivals up to July, 2022. This could be a result of internal factors such as the effects of the current economic and political situation in Sri Lanka and the external factors such as the

rising inflation and slowing growth that is indicative of stagflation in the main source markets. As of 31stJuly 2022, 458,670 international tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. The largest source markets recorded for the month of July were the United Kingdom, India, Germany followed by France and Canada.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

July 2022

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 62.8% of the total traffic received in July 2022. Pent up demand especially from countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 23.4% of total arrivals. The Americas accounted for 10.6% of the total traffic while the Middle East accounted for 2.7%.

The gradual improvement in international travel is once again threatened and it is anticipated that the spillovers from Ukraine war will sharply hasten the deceleration of global economic activity. The war is leading to high commodity prices, adding to supply disruptions, increasing food insecurity & poverty, exacerbating inflation contributing to tighter financial vulnerabilities and policy uncertainity (Global Economic Prospects, 2022). Coupled with these, the internal factors such as the current economic crisis could create dual shocks on tourism industry.

Top ten source markets

July 2022
