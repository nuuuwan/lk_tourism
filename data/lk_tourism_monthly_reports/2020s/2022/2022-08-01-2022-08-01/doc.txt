Summary

Tourist arrivals for the month of August have plunged by almost 65.5%, in comparison to March 2022, which recorded the highest number of tourist arrivals up to August, 2022. This could be a result of the effects of the current economic and political situation in Sri

Lanka, and the gradual cessation of the peak travel season. As of 31st August 2022, 496,430 international tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. The largest source markets recorded for the month of August were the United Kingdom, India, Germany followed by France and Canada.

August 2022

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 59.3 % of the total traffic received in August 2022 as a up demand especially from countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 28.0% of total arrivals. The Americas accounted for 10.0% of the total traffic while the Middle East accounted for 2.2%.

The gradual improvement in international travel was once again threatened by external factors such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, coupled with the related challenging economic environment, and internal factors such as the economic crisis in Sri Lanka .
