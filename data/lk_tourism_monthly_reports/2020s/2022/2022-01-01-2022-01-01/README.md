Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during January 2022 was 82,327. This significant improvement during the month of January follows the sharp contraction in arrivals after the month of April, 2021. This reflects the improvement in international arrivals potentially owing to factors such as vaccination advances around the world, softer restrictions for vaccinated travellers,

use of digital tools to facilitate safe travel, such as the EU COVID Certificate and growing consumer confidence in some outbound source markets.

The largest source markets recorded for the month of January were Russia, India, Ukraine, the United Kingdom,followed by Germany.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share January 2022

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 68.8% of the total traffic received in January 2022. Given the escalating number of COVID-19 cases, this can be considered as significant growth. Pent up demand especially from countries such as Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and Germany is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 23.7% of total arrivals. The Americas accounted for 4.5% of the total traffic while the Middle East accounted for 2.5%.

January being a peak month for tourist arrivals in Sri lanka, it is anticipated that arrivals will continue to grow towards the month of March. While signs of recovery were evident, the market uncertainity continues to overshadow the tourism industry with the escalating number of cases of the Omicron variant. It is expected that increasing cases in Europe will further dampen consumer confidence which was gradullay building after the devastating Delta variant. Hassle-free travelling in relation to the travel destination and in the outbound destination could be the motivating factors especially for the tourists from the Central/ Eastern European region.

Top ten source markets January 2022

The Russian Federation, India, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and Germany were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets for the month of January this year. Russia was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 16% of the total traffic received in January. An analysis of Russian arrivals in the consecutive years reveals that it has almost exceeded the pre pandemic levels as experienced in January 2019. This could be likely due to increased interest by Russian tour operators in alternative destinations to Thailand and Goa with strict

public health measures in place and the launching of direct flights to Russia. India and the Ukraine accounted for 14% and 10% of the total traffic respectively.The growth in arrivals from countries in the Americas, and Western, Central & Eastern Europe, suggests a revitalization of leisure tourism, potentially enabled by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions, the increased roll out of COVID-19 vaccine programs and the gradual containment of the pandemic in Sri Lanka.
