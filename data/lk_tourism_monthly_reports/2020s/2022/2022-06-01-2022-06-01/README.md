Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during June 2022 was 32,856. Tourist arrivals for the month of June have plunged by almost 69%, in comparison to March 2022, which recorded the highest number of tourist arrivals up to June, 2022. This could be a result of the effects of the current economic and political

situation in Sri Lanka, and the gradual cessation of the peak travel season. As of 30th June 2022, 411,377 international tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. The largest source markets recorded for the month of June were India, the United Kingdom, Autralia, followed by Germany and Canada.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

June 2022

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 47% of the total traffic received in June 2022. Pent up demand especially from countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 37.7% of total arrivals. The Americas accounted for 12.3% of the total traffic while the Middle East accounted for 2.4%.

The gradual improvement in international travel was once again threatened by external factors such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, coupled with the related challenging economic environment, and internal factors such as the economic crisis in Sri Lanka undermining consumer confidence, which was gradually building up.

Top ten source markets

June 2022

India, the United Kingdom, Australia Germany, and Canada were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets for the month of June this year. India was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 28% of the total traffic received in June. The United Kingdom and Australia accounted for 14% and 10% of the total traffic respectively while Germany and Canada accounted for 10% & 9%. The

advisories against travel to Sri Lanka by major source markets such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France due to political and economic unrest in Sri Lanka, could be the likely reasons for this decline. Further the rising inflation in the European region due to the war in Ukraine too could have detrimental effects on tourism in Sri Lanka.

Tourist arrivals by purpose of visit

June 2022

An analysis of tourist arrivals by purpose of visit reveals that a majority (41%) of tourists had visited Sri Lanka for visiting friends and relatives, while for 38% of tourists the main purpose was pleasure/vacation. In comparison to April 2022, the tourists who had visited Sri Lanka for pleasure/vacation purposes had decreased while tourists who had come for VFR purposes had increased. The reason could be the expatriates who are visiting their friends & relatives as 83% of arrivals from Canada and 61% of arrivals from Australia were for the purpose of VFR. Only 6% of tourists had visited for business related purposes. 1% had visited for health related purposes, while 1% and 0.02% had visited for purposes such as sports and education.

Targeting VFR segment as a viable source for Sri Lanka Tourism

Visiting friends and relatives (VFR) has become an important and unique segment of the inbound visitor economy over recent years and has been identified as a segment with many economic benefits and with great potential worldwide though they have been underestimated compared to pleasure market.

As revealed in many research studies there are several different reasons for the growth in the visiting friends and relatives market around the world. This includes globalization, a growing expat population, migration, freedom of movement, education and the desire to travel. (Tourism Teacher,2020) The VFR market offers a useful range of additional benefits for destinations looking to grow their visitor economy in a sustainable way (DMS,n.d).

1. They are more willing to travel outside of peak season, making them a perfect audience for any destination looking to ‘top-up’ their visitor numbers in the low or shoulder seasons. Balancing out business opportunities, year-round.

2. They tend to stay longer than other visitors: 60% stay for seven days or longer (Source: My Travel Research).

3. They are more likely to be repeat visitors; making, on average, between two to three VFR-related visits every year (Source: Elisa Backer and Brian King).

4. For a variety of reasons, the VFR market are frequent users of commercial accommodation.

As per the forecasts of Global Data, visiting friends and relatives (VFR) travel will experience higher growth, with a 17% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2021-25, compared to leisure, growing at a 16.4% increase between the same time period.

Source: Global Data

As pointed out by Shankman (2013) Visiting friends and relatives is the primary reason for travel for 20 percent of travellers in Asia. This segment is becoming more important as immigrant and expat communities grow in Asia Pacific destinations. In her analysis of VFR travel to India from Australia Shankman revealed that it is an important segment with a contribution of 43% and is becoming a emerging traveller type that will define the future of the industry.

Similarly Visiting friends and relatives travel can be considered as a significant market segment for Sri Lanka Tourism as vividly depicted in the arrival data since the month of May.

Chart 4: Tourist arrivals for VFR purposes from top source markets, June

The above chart 1 clearly shows the gradual decline experienced in arrivals in the month of April with the onset of the economic crisis and its related conditions. However, a gradual increase and a stabilisation in tourists arrivals was evident since the mid May and this could be owing to the temporary political stabilization and related conditions that created somewhat favourable environment. Thus, unlike in previous months the majority of these tourist arrivals did not constitute pleasure travellers, yet it constituted travellers who visited for VFR purposes.

As depicted in the chart 3 & 4, out of total arrivals in the month of June, the VFR constituted 41.4% while arrivals from the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada constituted 70%, 61% and 83% VFR arrivals respectively. India recorded 25.5% VFR arrivals while Germany recorded 38%.

The motive behind VFR travellers is created by a strong feeling to reconnect with their families and reaffirm their roots in their hometowns. Especially after a prolonged period of separation due to the pandemic, the need to reconnect with their families and friends have become stronger than ever before. Even though platforms such as Zoom, Facebook, Wats App bridged the gap virtually, the need to join physically with the loved ones have created a strong demand for VFR travel.

When it comes to inbound VFR travel to Sri Lanka, the factors such as the easing of travel restrictions such as the elimination of PCR tests and the mandatory travel insurance could be the motivating factors for this segment to visit their relatives and friends in Sri Lanka. Given the current political and economic crisis in Sri Lanka, VFR travel could be a viable market segment for forex crisis too. Unlike pleasure travellers, the VFR travellers are much familiar with the country and equipped with the knowledge to involve in tourism related activities even during a difficult situation. Therefore, focusing on VFR segment as a source of tourism would be an ideal contemporary solution.

As per the findings of Nielsen Global Trust, 83% (qtd. in Global Data) of consumers trust recommendations from friends and family more than any other form of marketing. Given the nature of forex crisis currently faced in Sri Lanka activating the VFR market leverages the most powerful marketing tool available: Word of Mouth (WOM), which is free of charge. Further, research also provided strong evidence that the VFR market is less affected by seasonality and external threats than other segments. Thus, in an off-peak season starting from May to October, VFR segment could be an ideal segment for a destination like Sri Lanka to target. With the travel advisories issued by main source markets like the United Kingdom and others, VFR segment could be the only resilient segment under the given social and economic conditions in Sri Lanka.

Thus encouraging higher rates of visitation from the VFR segment, especially for a destination like Sri Lanka could be a timely solution. Bonhill-Smith (qtd. in Global Data) points out that destinations can issue special visas or requirements that will make it easier for families to reunite. Airlines can ensure popular VFR routes are some of the first to be restored, hospitality businesses and attraction operators could offer incentives and discounts for families. All industries across the travel sector could be better informed to have a greater understanding of this tourism market. Thus, given the dire situation currently encountered by the Sri Lanka Tourism, encouraging higher rates of visitation of VFR travel through the adoption of above strategies could be the most timely strategy to ensure the wellbeing of the industry.
