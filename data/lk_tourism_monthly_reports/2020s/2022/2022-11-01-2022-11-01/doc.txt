Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 57.6% of the total traffic received in November 2022. Pent up demand especially from countries such as Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and Germany is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 32.4% of total arrivals. The easing and lifting of travel restrictions throughout the world, improved air accessibility through direct flights such as Aeoroflot, Azur Air, Edelweiss Air, Air France and ect. combined with increased frequencies of Airlines such as Emirates, newly introduced budget flights such as Fits Air and improved conditions in Sri Lanka could have contributed to this growth momentum.

The Americas accounted for 7.2% of the total traffic while the Middle East accounted for 0.6 %. Generally, the challenging economic environment including high inflation and escalating oil prices caused by the war in Ukraine are the possible hurdles that could affect the pace of tourism recovery.

Top primary markets and top potential markets

Top primary markets - January ~ November 2022

Note: The top primary markets for Sri Lanka have been identified using visitor arrivals data during the last six months. The previous methodology used to identify the markets was altered due to the current arrival trends in the source markets and the economic crisis in Sri Lanka. The intention is to track these source markets on a go-forward basis to understand future performance of Sri Lanka’s tourism economy, including during the projected international tourism recovery period, 2022-2025.

The impact of visa facilitation on tourism industry

In an era where COVID-19 pandemic brought about sweeping changes on the travel behaviour, easing the movement of people, especially the tourists is vital to revive the tourism industry, battered by an unprecedent crisis. Facilitating travel is an essential step to kick start not only the tourism industry but also the other crucial industries that are vital to an economy. Accordingly, many countries around the globe have introduced various methods in terms of visa facilitation to reduce the barriers and bottlenecks that limit the movement of tourists that are crucial for their economies. The recent initiative by Sri Lankan Government to relax visa regulations and extended stay allowance from 30 days to between 180 and 270 days is a welcoming gesture to the tourism industry, that is awaiting a boost. In addition, the visa on arrival facility introduced to Indian tourists is another recent initiative targeted to facilitate and bolster the industry. Though not directly related to tourism, the Golden Paradise Resident Visa programme for investors is another recent initiative taken by Sri Lanka in an effort to motivate more investments in to the island.

The flow of people across national borders is governed by the entry policies of countries. While some countries/regions practice open visa policies, other countries practice stringent visa policies. Therefore, it is vital to dwell on the purpose of visa in order to understand the importance of it to a country. Among an array of functions visas are considered as an important tool for security, immigration control, limitation of entry, duration of stay and activities. On the other hand, visas also provide a means of raising revenue for the State. In addition, Visa policy can also be defined by a country’s law or national prerogatives. In some cases, a country will impose a visa on another because the other country requires a visa of the issuing country’s citizens – a policy known as ‘reciprocity’. In addition, visas can be used as an incentive to encourage support of a country’s foreign policy or retaliation in the case of disagreement. Further countries use visas to limit the number of tourists to their country for capacity reasons (WTTC & UNWTO, 2012).

Over the past decade, international travel has been supported by considerable changes in visa facilitation. The percentage of travellers required to obtain a traditional visa has decreased from 77% in 2008 to 53% in 2018 and reciprocal traditional visa restrictions have fallen from 57% to 22% in the same period. A shift has taken place from traditional visas (where one must apply in person at an embassy) to visa-on-arrival (from 6% to 16%), electronic, or e-visa (from 0% to 10%) and the removal of visas altogether (from 17% to 21%) between 2008 and 2018. As at August 2019, South East Asia, Oceania and East Africa are the most open destinations; whereas North America, Central Africa and North Africa remain the most restrictive regions (WTTC, 2019). As per the findings of UNWTO & WTTC in 2011 Turkey, Mexico, and Australia have the most open visa policies towards their current source markets with just 3%, 4%, and 4% of tourists requiring visas. In 2015, the Indonesian government introduced a 30-day visa waiver for the majority of source markets, mostly replacing its visa on-arrival. The resulting growth in annual visitor arrivals increased from 9.0% in the three years prior to 2015 to 15.5% in 2016 and an estimated 22% in 2017. The policy effectively led to a 24% uplift (8% p.a.) in inbound demand which in turn is responsible for 6% of employment supported by Travel & Tourism or 400,000 jobs. In 2014, the government of India introduced an e Visa for over 40 markets, which was then extended to cover the bulk of source markets in 2015. Following the change in visa policy, the growth in international arrivals accelerated from 5.8% in the three years prior to 2014 to 10% in 2016 and an estimated 15% in 2017. This figure contrasts with the counterfactual growth of 3.3% average growth should the policy not have been implemented (WTTC, 2019) Under the USA Visa Waiver Program Expansion (2008) USA

Monthly Tourist Arrivals Report November 2022

expanded its visa waiver program to include the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and the Republic of Korea, as these countries met regulatory requirements and agreements to enter into the program. Collectively, arrivals from these countries grew 46% over the following three-year period. The visa solutions that can facilitate the tourist arrivals vary from visa on arrival, visa free regional blocs, regional bloc visas, multi-year visas, positive reciprocity, Unilateral opening of visa regimes, more visa related information online and a simpler visa process that includes fewer documents, lower fees, online application and e visas (UNWTO & WTTC, 2012).

Especially after the COVID-19 many countries suffered a severe drop in tourism revenue, and they came up with novel ideas such as Digital Nomad Visas that could bring back tourism revenue. The work from home arrangements practiced during the COVID-19 pandemic became a new norm in the post COVID period with the introduction of such programmes. Currently there are more than 40 countries offering Digital Nomad Visas and some of these countries include Georgia, Croatia, Germany, Norway, Portugal and Spain (Nomad Girl, 2022). They target not only Digital Nomads but also their families with home schooling and online schooling becoming more and more popular.

The impact of these newly introduced visa solutions in Sri Lanka is yet to be explored. Many countries are moving away from the traditional visa policies that have been identified as an obstacle especially for tourism and economic growth. Digital Nomad Visas being one of the recent novel concepts in visa facilitation, countries around the globe have adopted and in the process of introducing new visa facilitation procedures to boost their economies. However, as depicted in the above examples, the visa facilitation clearly has a positive impact on the tourist arrivals and on the economy as a whole and thus can be used as a vital tool especially for tourism industry.

Top ten source markets

November 2022

The Russian Federation, India, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets for the month of November this year. Russian Federation was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 23% of the total traffic received in November. India accounted for 17% and Germany 9% of the total traffic respectively, while the United Kingdom accounted for 8% and Australia represent 5%. It is noteworthy that Russian

Federation has moved up the top ten source markets after the month of February 2022. The improved air accessibility with two direct flights from Russia amalgamated with factors such as improved conditions in Sri Lanka could have boosted the arrival numbers. In addition, the arrival of two cruise ships with 1,854 tourists from Germany too had a considerable contribution for the growth in tourist arrivals.
