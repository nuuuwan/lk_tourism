Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during March 2022 was 106,500. This significant rebound during the month of March follows the sharp contraction in arrivals after the month of April, 2021. This reflects the improvement in international arrivals potentially owing to factors such as vaccination advances around the world, easing or lifting of travel restrictions and

growing consumer confidence in some outbound source markets.

As of 31st March 2022, 285,334 international tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. The largest source markets recorded for the month of March were India, the United Kingdom, Germany, followed by Russia Federation and France.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

March 2022

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 58.1% of the total traffic received in March 2022. Pent up demand especially from countries such as India, the United Kingdom, Germany and France is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 32% of total arrivals. The Middle East accounted for 3.1% of the total traffic while the Americas accounted for 6%.

The gradual improvement in international travel was once again threatned by the Russian invasion of Ukraine coupled with related challanging economic environment, undermining consumer confidence which was gradually building up. The Eastern European market, especially Russia and Ukrainine which gained a significant weight since the early January 2021 is gradually waning while the Asia and Pacific is gaining momentum.

Top primary markets

Note: The top primary markets for Sri Lanka have been identified using a combination of historical visitor arrivals data, total outbound market size data, overall size of the economy, recent consumer sentiment data and other variables. The intention is to track these source markets on a go-forward basis to understand future performance for Sri Lanka’s tourism economy, including during the projected international tourism recovery period, 2022-2025 (source: Pacific Asia Travel Association, January, 2021). * A prolonged absence of Ukrainian and Russian tourists is anticipated due to the current conflict and its longterm implications. Accordingly, Russia is unlikely to be a primary market for Sri Lanka from February onwards.

Top ten source markets

March 2022

India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Russian Federation and France were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets for the month of March this year. India was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 22% of the total traffic received in March. The on arrival visa facility introduced for the Indian tourists could have partly contributed for the increased arrivals from India. The United Kingdom and Germany accounted for 12% and 9% of the total traffic while Russia and France accounted for 8% & 5% respectively. The gradual declining of Russian tourists arrivals is noteworthy

maily due to the ongoing war coupled with related socio economic conditions. Further, the cessation of direct flights between Russia and Sri Lanka could have further dampen the arrival numbers. Growth in arrivals from countries in the Asia and Pacific, Western, Central & Eastern Europe, suggests a revitalization of leisure tourism, potentially enabled by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions, the gradual shrinking cases of Omicron varient and the gradual containment of the pandemic in Sri Lanka.
