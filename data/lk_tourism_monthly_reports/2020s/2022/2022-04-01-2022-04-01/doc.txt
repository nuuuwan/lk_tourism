Summary

A total of 62,980 international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka were recorded during April 2022. Tourist arrivals for the month of April have plunged by almost 40.8%, in comparison to March 2022, which recorded the highest number of tourist arrivals up to April, 2022. This could be a result of the effects of the current economic and political

situation in Sri Lanka, and the gradual cessation of the peak travel season.

As of 30th April 2022, 348,314 international tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. The largest source markets recorded for the month of April were the United Kingdom, India, and Germany, followed by France and the Russian Federation.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

April 2022

Map 1. Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share, April 2022

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 66.2% of the total arrivals in April 2022. Pent up demand especially from countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France is likely to have driven this growth. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 24.6% of total arrivals. The Middle East accounted for 1.7% of the total traffic, while the Americas accounted for 6.8%.

The gradual improvement in international travel was once again threatened by external factors such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, coupled with the related challenging economic environment, and internal factors such as the economic crisis in Sri Lanka undermining consumer confidence, which was gradually building up.

The intention is to track these source markets on a go-forward basis to understand future performance for Sri Lanka’s tourism economy, including during the projected international tourism recovery period, 2022-2025 (source: Pacific Asia Travel Association, January, 2021).

Top ten source markets

April 2022

The United Kingdom, India, Germany, France and the Russian Federation were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets for the month of April this year. The United Kingdom was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 18.0% of the total traffic received in April. India and Germany accounted for 14.0% and 10.0% of the total traffic respectively, while France and the Russian Federation accounted for 6.9% (both). India being a major source market to Sri Lanka, saw a considerable decline of 62.6% of tourist arrivals compared to March. With the easing of travel protocols such as the scrapping of the “Test and Go” policy, and the lowering of travel insurance costs, Thailand has its sights set on

increasing growth from India (Bhutia, 2022). With the current internal economic and political crisis, combined with this kind of increased promotional initiatives by regional competitors, Sri Lanka faces increased challenges in wooing Indian travel consumers in the near future.

Growth in arrivals from countries in Asia and the Pacific, and Western, Central & Eastern Europe, suggests a revitalization of leisure tourism & VFR, potentially enabled by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions, the gradual shrinking number of cases of the Omicron variant, and the gradual containment of the pandemic in Sri Lanka.

Top ten markets versus main last departure airports and main airlines to Sri Lanka April 2022

The below tables depict the main last departure airports and airlines analysed by top markets to Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan Airlines and IndiGo are the most popular airlines for Indians.

For a majority of travellers from Germany, France, Canada, the United States and Switzerland, Qatar Airways is the most preferable airline and Doha is the main last departure airport. Table 4.
