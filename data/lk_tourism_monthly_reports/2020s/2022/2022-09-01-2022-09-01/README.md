Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

September 2022

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 44.4% of the total traffic received in September 2022. Pent up demand especially from countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 44.3% of total arrivals. It is noteworthy, as regions Europe and Asia & Pacific record equal market shares. The easing and lifting of travel restrictions throughout the world and relaxing of travel advisories to Sri Lanka could have contributed to this growth momentum.

The Americas accounted for 8.9% of the total traffic while the Middle East accounted for 1.9%.

Generally, the challenging economic environment including high inflation and escalating oil prices caused by the war in Ukraine continues to hinder the recovery of tourism as depicted in the arrival figures.
