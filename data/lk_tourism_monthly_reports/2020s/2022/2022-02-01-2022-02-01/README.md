Summary

The total number of international tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka during February 2022 was 96,507. This significant improvement during the month of February follows the sharp contraction in arrivals after the month of April, 2021. This reflects the improvement in international arrivals potentially owing to factors such as vaccination advances around the world, softer restrictions for vaccinated travellers,

use of digital tools to facilitate safe travel, such as the EU COVID Certificate and growing consumer confidence in some outbound source markets.

As of 28th February 2022, 178,834 international tourists had visited Sri Lanka for this year. The largest source markets recorded for the month of february were Russia, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, followed by France.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

February 2022

Map 1.Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share

Europe became the largest source of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka with 73.3% of the total traffic received in February 2022. Pent up demand especially from countries such as Russia, India, the United Kingdom, Germany and France is likely to have driven this growth momentum. Asia and the Pacific accounted for 19.5% of total arrivals. The Middle East accounted for 2.5% of the total traffic while the Americas accounted for 4.2%.

February being a peak month for tourist arrivals in Sri lanka, it is anticipated that arrivals will continue to grow towards the month of March, expect for arrivals especially from Eastern Europen countries such as Russia and Ukraine. While signs of recovery were evident till the end of February , again the market uncertainity continues to overshadow the tourism industry with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia that has sent shocking waves to many destinations. It is expected that the cirisis in Ukraine will have far reaching implications on many source markets and will further dampen consumer confidence which was gradullay building after the devastating Omicron variant.

Top primary markets

Note: The top primary markets for Sri Lanka have been identified using a combination of historical visitor arrivals data, total outbound market size data, overall size of the economy, recent consumer sentiment data and other variables. The intention is to track these source markets on a go-forward basis to understand future performance for Sri Lanka’s tourism economy, including during the projected international tourism recovery period, 2022-2025 (source: Pacific Asia Travel Association, January, 2021). * A prolonged absence of Ukrainian and Russian tourists is anticipated due to the current conflict and its longterm implications. Accordingly, Russia is unlikely to be a primary market for Sri Lanka from February onwards.

The impact of Ukraine crisis on Sri Lanka Tourism

The travel industry that was battered by COVID 19 and related conditions in the last two years was gradually reinvigorating and was anticipating a boom, when again faced with another shock and uncertainty with the crisis in Ukraine. This will result in serious implications for destinations including Sri Lanka, that rely on Eastern European markets for their inbound tourism.

Russians and Ukrainians are known and valued for their resilient nature in terms of travel behaviour and longer duration of stay. In 2019, Russian travelers have taken more than 40 million trips, becoming one of the fast growing outbound markets as the sixth highest international visitor spending (Grima, 2022)The expenditure per day (non-package excluding air fare) of a Russian tourist in Sri Lanka was about USD 162.94 for the year 2018 while an expenditure per day of USD 164.24 had been recorded for a Ukrainian tourist (The survey on Departing Foreign Tourists, 2018). Ukrainians were the first batch of tourists to arrive in Sri Lanka during the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2020 and Russia was among the top ten source markets of Sri Lanka. According to Forwardkeys, prior to the invasion, Russian outbound flight bookings for March to May had recovered to 32% of pre-pandemic levels, with some holiday hotspots doing exceptionally well. Sri Lanka had occupied the 10th position (with a share of 7%) among the top 20 most booked destinations by Russians for the period of March to May 2022(Hamdi, 2022). Russian tourist arrivals recorded for the year 2020 and 2021 are 49, 397 and 16,894 respectively. While 17,169 and 7,037 Ukrainian tourist arrivals had been recorded for the consecutive years of 2020 and 2021 respectively. This growth momentum continues to 2022, with 28, 818 total Russian arrivals and 13,062 Ukrainian arrivals recorded from 1st of January to 28th February, exceeding pre pandemic levels. The tourism reopening time in Sri Lanka in comparison to other similar destinations such as Thailand, promotion initiatives with Russia and initiation of direct flights could be attributed as the main factors behind this growth since October 2021.

Given the importance of especially the Russian market, the implications of this crisis will be far reaching for Sri Lanka tourism especially for a prolonged period of time. As voiced by several major travel agents in Sri Lanka, they are already getting cancellations from Russian tourists and no new bookings had been received. Accordingly, following factors can be pointed out as major impediments in relation to outbound travel and prolonged absence of tourists especially from Russia and Ukraine that in turn will affect Sri Lanka tourism.

• Devaluation of Rouble which has plunged by 30 percent against the Dollar. This will crimp the spending power of Russian travelers. • The impact of declared sanctions against Russia and the adverse impact on the economy. The West is already pushing international companies to halt sales, cut ties, and dump tens of billions of dollars’ worth of investments in Russia. • The removal of Russia’s central bank and other Russian banks from the SWIFT global payments system • Disrupted flights Russia’s airspace is the popular overflight for EU flights en route to Asia. As highlighted by Bloomberg and CNN the European Union have closed all airspace across its 27 countries to Russian airplanes by Sunday and Russia has reciprocated with its own bans, causing airlines to fly circuitous intercontinental routes. This will have implications for other European markets as well. European carriers going in the other direction face

delays and higher fuel expense, after Russia, a key pathway to Asia, began blocking access.

Countries such as Turkey, United Kingdom, Japan, Poland have suspended their flights to Russia and Russia has reciprocated with its own bans. Aeroflot, Rossiya and Pobeda operate a fleet of more than 300 mostly Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Sanctions announced by European Commission, specifically banning the sale of European aircraft to Russia, imperiling further Airbus deliveries to them will have serious implications that will hinder the air connectivity for Russians in the long run. In addition foreign leased aircrafts of Areoflot is to suspend flights of passengers and cargo. Further U.S. sanctions announced by President Joe Biden also include export controls, prohibiting the sale of U.S. technologies that can be used by aerospace companies. This may extend to technologies used in Boeing aircraft (Unnikrishnan, 2022) Closure of airspace; Source: CNN

• Surge in aviation fuel that will be reflected through the increase in airfares. Oil prices have surged above US$100 a barrel for the first time in seven years. • Low travel sentiment owing to above factors and fears of not been able to return. • Devastating impact of war on the Ukrainian economy, society and its inhabitants will have lasting effects on their lives, making travel a least requirement/priority The impact on other European source markets of Sri Lanka • Surge in air fares and longer travel duration due to overflight restrictions • Due to the economic ties with Eastern Europe, especially Russia, the repercussions of the war will adversely affect the spending power of the travelers • Air connectivity issues

Accordingly, a protracted absence of Eastern European travellers, especially from Russia and Ukraine is to be anticipated given the nature of crisis in Ukraine and its current and future implications. The market share of Russia and Ukraine out of total arrivals for year 2019 was 6.3 % while the market share for 2021 was 12.2%. Therefore, it is high time to diversify the markets and concentrate on new primary and potential markets with larger economies, large outbound populations and high yield.

Top ten source markets

February 2022

The Russian Federation, India, the United Kingdom, Germany and France were Sri Lanka’s top five international tourist generating markets for the month of February this year. Russia was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 16% of the total traffic received in February. An analysis of Russian arrivals in the consecutive years reveals that it has almost exceeded the pre pandemic levels and and reached an increase of more than a two fold as compared to February 2019. This could be likely due to increased interest by Russian tour operators in alternative destinations to Thailand and Goa with strict public health measures in place and the launching of direct flights to Russia. According to Forwardkeys, Sri Lanka had occupied the 10th position (with a share of 7%) among the top 20 most

booked destinations by Russians for the period of March to May 2022. However, the continuity of this growth momentum could be stalled for a prolonged period of time due to the current crisis in Ukraine. India and the United Kingdom accounted for 13% and 11% of the total traffic respectively.The on arrival visa facility introduced for the Indian tourists could have partly contributed for the increased arrivals from India.The growth in arrivals from countries in the Asia and Pacific, Western, Central & Eastern Europe, suggests a revitalization of leisure tourism, potentially enabled by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions, the gradual shrinking cases of Omicron varient and the gradual containment of the pandemic in Sri Lanka.
