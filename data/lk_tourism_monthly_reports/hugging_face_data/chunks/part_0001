In addition to the pent-up demand, the relaxation of travel restrictions in various source markets is also crucial in the travel recovery.The top countries of origin for tourists in January were Russian Federation, India, the United Kingdom, Germany and France.\n\nTable 1.

It is believed that\n\npent-up demand from countries such as\n\nthe Russian Federation, UK, Germany,\n\nFrance and Israel contributed to this\n\nincrease in tourism.\n\nMeanwhile, 25.3% of tourists came from\n\nAsia and the Pacific region, 6.4% from the\n\nAmericas, and 1.5% from the Middle East.\n\nFactors such as the lifting of travel\n\nrestrictions and improved air accessibility\n\nin Sri Lanka could be the factors that\n\ncontributed to the growth in tourism.\n\nAccording to the UNWTO, international\n\ntourism is expected to further recover in\n\n2023 due to growing demand. However,the\n\ninternational tourism's sustained recovery\n\nmay be hindered by economic, health and\n\ngeopolitical obstacles.\n\nAMERICAS\n\n6,652 6.4 %\n\nAFRICA\n\n459 0.4 %\n\nEUROPE 67,855\n\n66.1%\n\nMIDDLE EAST\n\n1,570 1.5 %\n\nASIA & PACIFIC\n\n26,009 25.3 %\n\n5\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report December 2022\n\nTop primary markets and top potential markets"

The concept of \"niche tourism\" draws inspiration from \"niche marketing,\" which itself originated from the field of ecology (Stainton, 2020). Unlike mass tourism, niche tourism focuses on a smaller number of consumers but forms a consistent market within the tourism industry. Rather than emphasizing the quantity of visitors to a specific location at a given time, niche tourism is defined by the activities and interests of the tourists themselves."

Rather than emphasizing the quantity of visitors to a specific location at a given time, niche tourism is defined by the activities and interests of the tourists themselves.\n\nNiche tourism in Sri Lanka can take various forms, including but not limited to eco-tourism, cultural tourism, adventure tourism, wildlife tourism, wellness tourism, and gastronomic tourism. Each niche presents an opportunity to highlight Sri Lanka's distinct features, such as its stunning landscapes, ancient heritage sites, vibrant local communities, biodiversity, traditional arts, and culinary delights. By focusing on these niche segments, Sri Lanka can attract discerning travelers who are willing to pay more for authentic and sustainable experiences.\n\nDeveloping niche tourism products in Sri Lanka also contributes to the overall sustainability of the tourism sector. Niche tourism tends to have a smaller environmental footprint compared to mass tourism, as it emphasizes responsible practices, community involvement, and conservation efforts. By promoting sustainable tourism practices within niche segments, Sri Lanka can protect its natural and cultural resources for future generations while reaping the economic benefits of tourism."

Prior to the pandemic, tourism played a vital role in the country's economy, contributing to foreign exchange earnings, employment generation, and overall economic growth. However, the arrival of COVID-19 and the subsequent travel restrictions and lockdown measures resulted in a sharp decline in tourist arrivals and a significant reduction in tourism-related revenue.\n\nSri Lanka's tourism sector experienced a substantial decline in 2020. In 2018, tourism contributed 4.6% to the nation's GDP and earned $4.3 billion in earnings. However, in 2020, tourism's contribution to GDP plummeted to a mere 0.8%.

For instance, Russian tourists commonly choose Red Wings and Aeroflot, whereas Indian tourists tend to favour Sri Lankan Airlines and IndiGo. In comparison, Sri Lankan Airlines is a popular choice among tourists from countries like the United Kingdom, France, Australia, the United States, Maldives, and Canada.

For instance, Indian tourists commonly choose Sri Lankan Airlines and IndiGo, whereas Russian tourists tend to favour Red Wings and Aeroflot. In comparison, Sri Lankan Airlines is a popular choice among tourists from countries like the United Kingdom, Australia, United States, Maldives, and Canada. It is worth noting that German tourists frequently choose Qatar Airways and utilize Doha as their primary last departure airport and France tourists frequently choose Emirates.This highlights the crucial role of destination accessibility in promoting tourism.\n\nTable 4.

The majority of tourists, accounting for 52% of all visits, chose to explore the country for pleasure or vacation purposes. This significant percentage highlights Sri Lanka's appeal as a sought-after destination for leisure travelers in search of relaxation and enjoyable experiences. Additionally, 23% of tourists visited the country to reconnect with friends and relatives, showcasing the nation's ability to attract individuals with personal connections or a desire to foster relationships with loved ones residing in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn contrast, business-related reasons contributed to only 4% of tourist visits, indicating a relatively small segment of visitors arriving for professional engagements. Further insights indicate that a modest percentage of tourists, 5%, arrived in Sri Lanka for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) purposes, reflecting the country's growing presence as a venue for such events. Additionally, a smaller fraction of 0.37% and 0.36% visited for health/Ayurvedic and educational purposes, respectively, illustrating niche interests that contribute to the diverse array of motivations bringing tourists to the country.These findings underscore Sri Lanka's multifaceted appeal and highlight its attractiveness as a destination that caters to a wide range of traveler preferences and objectives"

These countries played a pivotal role in driving the surge in tourist arrivals, contributing substantially to the overall recovery of Sri Lanka's tourism sector.\n\nAdditionally, when comparing tourist arrivals in August 2023 to July 2023, there was a notable decrease of 4.6%. This decline in arrivals indicates a temporary dip in tourist activity during this period. It's important to consider various factors that could contribute to such fluctuations, including seasonal variations, and other external factors impacting tourism trends.\n\nTable 1.

This trend suggests a promising trajectory for tourism as Sri Lanka steadily recovers from various challenges.\n\nSeptember 2023 stands out with the highest percentage increase compared to 2022, marking an extraordinary 275.6% rise. Additionally, July recorded the highest number of arrivals for the year, reaching an impressive 143,039 tourists. Monthly variations in arrivals reflect seasonal changes influenced by holidays, weather patterns, and other factors, underlining the dynamic nature of tourism in the country.\n\nNoteworthy is Sri Lanka's achievement of surpassing one million tourists in September, marking a significant milestone. After 2019, this is the first time that Sri Lanka has experienced such a substantial increase in tourist arrivals, exceeding the one-million mark. During the initial eight months of the year, India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France dominated as the top source markets for Sri Lankan tourism, contributing significantly to the influx of tourists. Furthermore, China has emerged as a prominent market among these top source countries.\n\nSri Lanka's tourism sector is poised for a notable resurgence, attributed to several factors such as improved accessibility, recent prestigious accolades, and other advancements. Nevertheless, as per the UNWTO, the challenging economic environment may influence spending patterns in the remaining part of the year. Travelers are increasingly emphasizing value for their money, favoring nearby destinations, and opting for shorter vacations.\n\nMonth\n\nTourist Arrivals"

This decline can likely be attributed to the gradual decrease in arrivals from key source markets such as India, China, Australia, and Israel.\n\nBetween January and October 2023, Sri Lanka achieved an impressive milestone in cumulative tourist arrivals, exceeding the previous year's figure of 568,258 by reaching a total of 1,125,455 visitors.\n\nIn September 2023, Sri Lanka's tourism sector saw a significant surge in visitors, with India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China emerging as the leading source markets. These countries played a crucial role in fueling the increase in tourist arrivals, making a substantial contribution to the overall revival of Sri Lanka's tourism industry\n\nTable 1.

This shift in the origins of tourists\n\nhighlights the evolving dynamics within Sri\n\nLanka's tourism industry, with Asia and the\n\nPacific playing a substantial role and Europe\n\nemerging as a crucial source of tourists.\n\nThe increase in tourism can be attributed to\n\nthe growing demand from countries like\n\nIndia, Russia, China, the United Kingdom,\n\nand Germany, all of which have played a\n\nsubstantial role in strengthening Sri Lanka's\n\ntourism sector.\n\nTo explore these contributions further, the\n\nAmericas have constituted 4.8% of the\n\noverall tourist arrivals, whereas the Middle\n\nEast has provided 1.5%. Each of these\n\nregions has played unique and discernible\n\nroles in shaping the characteristics of Sri\n\nLanka's tourism environment.\n\nThe outlook for September to December\n\n2023 suggests an ongoing recovery, as\n\nindicated by the most recent UNWTO\n\nConfidence Index.

Following closely were Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China, with each contributing 10%, 8%, 7%, and 6%, respectively. These statistics reflect changing preferences and travel patterns. Notably, there has been an increase in arrivals from China, India, Spain, and Germany in comparison to October last year, indicating a shift towards emerging destinations.\n\nSeveral factors, such as improved air connectivity, favorable local conditions, geographical proximity, and geopolitical considerations, have collectively established these countries as the primary contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism.\n\nThe growth rates of tourist arrivals from different countries have been influenced by global and local dynamics. India, Spain, Germany, and Australia have experienced significant growth in arrivals, while Russia, the United Kingdom, and the Maldives have shown the slowest growth rates compared to October 2022. This variation in growth rates can be attributed to evolving trends and responses to the current global and local conditions.\n\nChart 1.Top ten source markets to Sri Lanka, October 2023\n\n8\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report \u2013 October 2023\n\nIndia , 26%\n\nRussia , 10%\n\nUnited Kingdom, 8%\n\nGermany, 7%China, 6%Australia, 4%\n\nMaldives, 3%\n\nFrance, 3%\n\nUnited States,\n\n2%\n\nSpain, 2 %\n\nOther , 29, %\n\nTable 2.

This data underscores the country's strong appeal as a place for relaxation and enjoyable experiences. As illustrated by the purpose of visits statistics, October is not the favored month for visiting friends and relatives in Sri Lanka. Only 33% of British tourists, 39% of Australian tourists, 28% of American tourists, and 19% of French tourists primarily chose Sri Lanka as a destination to reconnect with friends and relatives. In addition, 13% of Indian tourists and 12% of Spanish visitors traveled to Sri Lanka for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) purposes. Furthermore, 6% of German tourists journeyed to Sri Lanka with the specific intention of seeking health-related services.

Notably, Israel's outbound travel sector has been experiencing remarkable growth. From 2010 to 2019, the number of Israeli international air travel increased more than twofold, surging from 3.6 million to 8.3 million, reflecting an impressive average annual growth rate of 10%(Ketter, n.d).\n\nIsrael stands out globally as a leader in the proportion of its population that seeks international adventures. Out of the approximately 9 million Israeli citizens, an astonishing 4.3 million took their travels overseas in 2019. The momentum continued into the first half of 2023 (January to June), with Israelis embarking on 4.5 million international journeys, surpassing the levels recorded in the previous peak year of 2019(Ketter, n.d.).What's striking is the diversity in age groups represented among these travelers, with around 20% of all international travelers from Israel being under the age of 20, underlining the broad appeal of outbound travel."

Yet, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine holds the potential to exert a considerable influence on outbound tourism from Israel. It has the capacity to discourage or interrupt the travel plans of Israeli citizens.\n\nAs of October 31, 2023, the total count of Israeli tourists who have journeyed to Sri Lanka stands at 18,909 while the arrivals recorded for the month of October was 460. However, the daily trend in tourist arrival figures signals a gradual decline in the number of Israeli visitors as depicted in Chart 6.\n\nChart 6: Israel tourist arrivals from 2012 to October 2023\n\nMonthly Tourits Arrivals Report \u2013October 2023\n\n13\n\nChart :7 Daily arrival distribution of tourist from Israel\n\nThis decline can likely be attributed to various factors."

These concerns may serve as a deterrent to potential outbound tourists.\n\nTransportation Disruptions: During times of war, transportation infrastructure can face significant disruptions, making it challenging for travelers to access airports, train stations, or border crossings. This can lead to the cancellation or rescheduling of outbound flights and other modes of transportation. Several airlines, including American Airlines, Delta, United Airlines, Air Canada, Air India, and Korean Air, have already suspended or adjusted their air services to Israel (The Economic Times, 2023). Such disruptions could compel outbound travelers to either delay or completely cancel their travel plans. Additionally, the ongoing situation may necessitate the rescheduling of Israeli airline Arkia's inaugural nonstop service between Tel Aviv and Sri Lanka, originally planned for the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nMonthly Tourits Arrivals Report \u2013October 2023 14\n\nEconomic Ramifications: During periods of conflict, the economy can experience a range of adverse effects. This can lead to economic difficulties that impact the cost of living, employment opportunities, and various other aspects. As reported by Reuters(2023), the Bank of Israel has reduced its economic growth projections for 2023 from 3% to 2.3%. Consequently, Israelis may opt to curtail their consumption expenditures and opt to save funds in preparation for unforeseen circumstances arising from the current uncertainty."

Hence, it's sensible to expect a gradual resurgence in outbound travel, underscoring the significance of avoiding premature assessments and hasty judgments regarding the complete scale and gravity of the damage resulting from the ongoing conflict\n\nReferences\n\neran-ketter-phd.

According to data from Chart 10, approximately 36% of tourists chose departure airports in Dubai, Doha, and Chennai as their last stop before reaching Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the top airlines favored by tourists arriving in Sri Lanka were Sri Lankan Airlines, Qatar Airways, and Emirates, collectively accounting for 55% of total tourist arrivals. This underscores the critical role of air transportation in facilitating tourism in Sri Lanka, with specific airports and airlines playing a prominent role in serving a substantial portion of visitors.\n\nChart 10.

For instance, Indian travelers commonly choose Sri Lankan Airlines and IndiGo, while Russian tourists tend to prefer Aeroflot and Red Wings. Conversely, Sri Lankan Airlines is a popular choice among tourists from the United Kingdom, Australia, Maldives, and France. Notably, German, American, and Spanish tourists often opt for Qatar Airways and use Doha as their primary departure hub. Emirates is a favored option for both German and British tourists.\n\nThis underscores the vital importance of accessibility in boosting tourism in Sri Lanka. It also emphasizes that tourists' choices regarding airlines and departure airports are significantly shaped by their home countries, highlighting the importance of convenient connections in drawing tourists to Sri Lanka. With the return of operations from airlines like Turkish Airlines in October and the introduction of other charter and scheduled flights in November, including Azur Air, Edelweiss, and Enter Air, the outlook for connectivity and an increase in tourists appears more promising.\n\nTable 6.

These nations played a pivotal role in driving the increase in tourist arrivals, making substantial contributions to the overall revitalization of Sri Lanka's tourism industry. As per UNWTO, the rate of recovery may experience a slowdown in Q4 2023 due to prevailing economic and geopolitical challenges. Nonetheless, it is expected that the total number of international arrivals will reach 1.3 billion in 2023. Despite enduring economic challenges such as high inflation and diminished output, coupled with specific geopolitical tensions and conflicts, international tourism is on a path towards regaining pre-pandemic levels by the year 2024.\n\nTable 1.

This\n\nchanging dynamics within Sri Lanka's\n\ntourism industry, with Europe playing a\n\nsubstantial role and Asia and the Pacific\n\nemerging as crucial contributors.\n\nThe upswing in tourism can be credited to the\n\nincreasing demand from countries such as\n\nIndia, Russia, Germany, the United\n\nKingdom, and Australia, all of which have\n\nplayed pivotal roles in fortifying Sri Lanka's\n\ntourism sector. To delve deeper into these\n\ncontributions, the Americas constituted 5% of\n\nthe total tourist arrivals, while the Middle East\n\nand Africa contributed 1.4% and 0.5%\n\nrespectively. Each of these regions has\n\nplayed distinct and discernible roles in\n\nshaping the characteristics of Sri Lanka's\n\ntourism landscape.\n\nAs per the latest World Economic Outlook released by the International Monetary Fund in October 2023, there is an indication of a sluggish and uneven global recovery. The forecast predicts a decline in global growth from 3.5% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2023. The escalation of geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Palestine remains a significant factor, posing potential risks to international tourism throughout the remaining months of 2023 and extending into 2024. Consequently, the achievement of Sri Lanka's target of attracting 1.5 million tourists is anticipated with varying numbers of tourists expected from different regions of the world.\n\nAMERICAS\n\n7,448\n\n5.0%\n\nAFRICA\n\n860 0.5%\n\nEUROPE 80,146\n\n53.0%\n\nMIDDLE EAST\n\n2,088\n\n1.4%\n\nASIA & PACIFIC\n\n60,954\n\n40.2%\n\n5\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report \u2013 November 2023\n\nTop primary markets and top potential markets\n\nTop primary markets, November 2023"

This thriving tourism sector not only generates income and livelihoods but also contributes significantly to foreign exchange earnings. Despite its evident importance, there has been a lack of information regarding its specific contribution to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To address this gap, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) initiated a study aimed at establishing the country's first Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), aligning with international guidelines set by the World Tourism Organization.\n\nThe information below delineates the TSA for the reference year 2018, recognizing its experimental nature due to limitations in available data. Despite encountering specific challenges that impeded the creation of an all-encompassing TSA, this inaugural effort has played a crucial role in surmounting obstacles for subsequent TSAs, with the groundwork for this ongoing process already laid.\n\nInbound Tourism"

This worked out to be USD 4713.77.\n\n\u2022 On further multiplying this with the USD to LKR exchange rate gave the inbound non-package tourism expenditure as LKR 766150.\n\n\u2022 Further, share of non-package tours in total is estimated to be 83 percent. Accordingly, total inbound expenditure (including both package and non-package components) worked out to be LKR 923,072 million.\n\n\u2022 The broad components were mapped with the TSA products and services and using the proportions as seen in domestic tourism expenditure for these products and services, the inbound tourism expenditure was estimated for all products and services. Hence, TSA Table 1 could be prepared for Sri Lanka Experimental TSA."

The domestic tourism expenditure was collected at fairly disaggregated level. Hence, the TSA Table 2 on Domestic Tourism Expenditure could be prepared directly from the survey findings.\n\nThe key findings are as follows:\n\n\uf0b7 Total domestic tourism expenditure is estimated at LKR 38,255 million. \uf0b7 Of the total domestic tourism expenditure, the highest, at 37.2 percent, is spent on country-specific goods. \uf0b7 Land passenger transport is the popular mode of transport among both inbound and domestic tourists . Food and beverage account for 17.9 percent and all other products and services account for only 13.7 percent of total domestic expenditure. \uf0b7 The average per-tourist expenditure is estimated at LKR 5475. Among the different purposes for travel, the highest per-tourist expenditure is recorded for a holiday/leisure trip, at LKR 8837. On the other hand, a health trip turns out to be the least expensive, at LKR 4242.\n\nOutbound Tourism\n\nIn the case of Sri Lanka, there is no data on outbound tourism expenditure.

For example, Indian travelers frequently opt for Sri Lankan Airlines and IndiGo, while Russian tourists lean towards Red Wings and Azur Air. On the other hand, Sri Lankan Airlines is a popular choice among tourists from the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, and Japan. Notably, German and French visitors often choose Qatar Airways and utilize Doha as their primary departure hub. Chinese tourists show a preference for China Eastern, while Fly Dubai is the top choice for tourists from Poland.\n\nThis underscores the critical role of accessibility in promoting tourism in Sri Lanka. It highlights that tourists' decisions regarding airlines and departure airports are significantly molded by their home countries, underscoring the importance of seamless connections in attracting visitors to Sri Lanka. The initiation of services by airlines such as Air Astana and Air Arabia, coupled with heightened Sri Lankan Airlines frequencies to key destinations like Mumbai, has marked a notable development in air travel connectivity.\n\nTable 4.

Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the total number of international arrivals will reach 1.3 billion in 2023. Despite grappling with economic issues such as high inflation and reduced output, as well as specific geopolitical tensions and conflicts, international tourism is on track to approach pre-pandemic levels by 2024. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council\u2019s (WTTC) 2023 Economic Impact Research (EIR), the Travel & Tourism sector is nearing its 2019 peak, recovering by over 95%.\n\nTable 1.

This alteration in the origin of\n\ntourists highlights the evolving dynamics in Sri\n\nLanka's tourism sector, with Europe playing a\n\nsignificant role and Asia and the Pacific\n\nemerging as key contributors.\n\nThe surge in tourism owes its momentum to\n\ngrowing demand from nations like India,\n\nRussia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and\n\nAustralia, all of which have significantly\n\nbolstered Sri Lanka's tourism sector. To\n\nexplore these contributions further, the\n\nAmericas made up 5.8% of the overall tourist\n\narrivals, with the Middle East and Africa\n\ncontributing 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively. Each\n\nof these regions has played unique and\n\ndiscernible roles in shaping the features of Sri\n\nLanka's tourism scenery.\n\nThe persistent geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Palestine remained significant factors, presenting potential risks to international tourism in the latter part of 2023. According to the IMF's 'World Economic Outlook,' a decline in global growth was expected, with a decrease from 3.5% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2023. However, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) anticipates that by the end of 2023, nearly half of the 185 countries will have either fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels or be within 95% of full recovery. Conversely, the economic outlook for 2024 is marked by high uncertainty, characterized by increasing interest rates, ongoing global conflicts, and a growing frequency of climate disasters (Harverd Business Review, 2023).\n\nAMERICAS\n\n12,405\n\n5.8%\n\nAFRICA 2,031\n\n0.9%\n\nEUROPE 108,184\n\n51.4%\n\nMIDDLE EAST\n\n2,475\n\n1.1%\n\nASIA & PACIFIC\n\n85,257\n\n40.5%\n\n5\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report \u2013 December 2023\n\nTop primary markets and top potential markets"

This surge was attributed to the continuation of the peak tourism season and favorable local and international conditions, contributing to the overall revitalization of the tourism sector.\n\nAccording to the UNWTO World Tourism Barometer, global international tourist arrivals reached an estimated 1,286 million in 2023, marking a 34% increase from 2022. With strong pent-up demand, international tourism has rebounded to 88% of pre-pandemic levels, and it is anticipated to fully recover by 2024, with a projected 2% growth above 2019 levels. Positive sentiments are reflected in the latest UNWTO Tourism Confidence Index survey, with 67% of industry professionals expressing optimism for 2024 compared to 2023. The expected full recovery by the end of 2024 is attributed to the release of pent-up demand, improved air connectivity, and the stronger rebound of Asian markets and destinations.\n\nTable 1.

    "chunk_text": "In February 2024, Sri Lanka witnessed a substantial upsurge in international tourist arrivals, marking an impressive 102.09% increase from the previous year, totaling 218,350 visitors. This surge was attributed to sustained peak tourism season momentum and favorable local and international conditions, contributing significantly to the overall rejuvenation of the tourism sector.\n\nAccording to the most recent projections by PATA, international visitor arrivals (IVA) are expected to\n\nsee substantial growth in 2024, surpassing the volume recorded in 2019. Furthermore, the forecasts suggest that this trend of annual increases will persist into both 2025 and 2026.\n\nAs per the UNWTO, despite the pandemic challenges, international tourism has rebounded to 88% of pre-pandemic levels, driven by strong pent-up demand. Forecasts indicate a complete recovery by 2024, with a projected 2% growth surpassing 2019 levels. Industry optimism is high, with 67% of professionals expressing positivity for 2024 compared to the preceding year, according to the latest UNWTO Tourism Confidence Index survey. The anticipated recovery by the end of 2024 is credited to the release of pent-up demand, improved air connectivity, and the robust resurgence of Asian markets and destinations\n\nTable 1.

The substantial increase in visitors from\n\nthese countries significantly contributed to boosting Sri Lanka's tourism sector.\n\nBy 2024, it is expected that international tourist arrivals will completely rebound, surpassing 2019 levels with a projected growth of 2%. The recent UNWTO Tourism Confidence Index survey indicates positive sentiment, with 67% of industry professionals showing optimism for 2024 compared to the previous year. The anticipated full recovery by the end of 2024 is credited to the release of pent-up demand, enhancements in air connectivity, and the resurgence of Asian markets and destinations.\n\nTable 1.

These figures underscore changing travel preferences. Significantly, there was a rise in arrivals from China, Poland, and the United Kingdom compared to the previous year, indicating a shift towards emerging destinations. Poland's notable inclusion in the top ten source markets is noteworthy. However, Canada experienced a decrease in tourist arrivals compared to the previous March, despite being in the top ten list. This decline might be attributed to the absence of the diaspora visiting friends and relatives during this period.\n\nThe combined influence of factors like the current peak season, enhanced air links, favorable local settings, geographical proximity, and geopolitical conditions has significantly boosted these nations' importance as major contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism industry.\n\nChart 1.Top ten source markets to Sri Lanka, March 2024\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report March 2024\n\n5\n\nIndia ,15%\n\nRussia\n\n14%\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n10%\n\nGermany\n\n9%China\n\n6%France 5%\n\nAustralia\n\n4%\n\nUnited States\n\n4%\n\nPoland\n\n2%\n\nCanada\n\n2%\n\nOther\n\n29%\n\nTable 2.

According to data from the UNWTO in 2019, Europe witnessed a staggering 743.9 million international tourist arrivals, constituting slightly more than half, or 51%, of the total global outbound tourism, which amounted to 1.465 billion international arrivals. As of 2022, Europe's contribution to global outbound tourism had surged to 62%, with international arrivals reaching 595 million, equivalent to 80% of the 2019 volume. While this proportion might decline as tourism normalizes, it remains a reliable gauge of Europe's market robustness. Additionally, air passenger traffic data underscores Europe's pandemic recovery progress, with figures showing an impressive rebound to 86% of the 2019 level by Q3 2022 (www.cbi.eu, n.d.).\n\nChart 6 : Air Passenger traffic 2019 to 2022 (q3)\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report March 2024\n\n10\n\nTable: 4 The performance of Europe as a key source market to Sri Lanka\n\nTotal Tourist Arrivals Up to\n\nMarch 2018\n\nTotal Tourist Arrivals Up to\n\nMarch 2023\n\nTotal Tourist Arrivals Up to\n\nMarch 2024\n\n% Change \u2013\n\nMarch (2018 /2024)\n\n% Change \u2013\n\nMarch (2023 /2024)"

In March 2018, arrivals from the main European regions declined, except for Central and Eastern Europe, which saw a growth rate of 101.75%. However, comparing arrivals up to March in 2023 and 2024 shows positive growth rates across all regions, with Northern Europe experiencing the highest growth at 111.04%. The presence of the United Kingdom in this region likely contributes significantly to this growth trend. Central and Eastern Europe exhibited the lowest growth rates at 55.9%, with the Russian Federation and Poland identified as the main contributors to this region's arrivals.\n\nIn 2024, Europe's outbound tourism is forecasted to stabilize to consistent growth levels after a period of slowdown. Projections suggest that Europe will witness stable growth levels in outbound travel, indicating a normalization of the tourism sector (Skift Research, n.d.). Optimistic projections from previous years estimated outbound tourism from Europe to reach approximately 86.9 million trips by 2024. (www.cbi.eu, n.d.). Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Europe is expected to resume its role as a significant contributor to global outbound tourism. This stabilization reflects the gradual recovery and normalization of travel patterns in the region, with travelers increasingly returning to international destinations (www.cbi.eu, n.d.)."

The latest UNWTO Tourism Confidence Index survey reflects a positive outlook, with 67% of industry experts expressing optimism for 2024 compared to the preceding year. The expected full recovery by the conclusion of 2024 is attributed to the release of pent-up demand, improvements in air connectivity, and the revitalization of Asian markets and destinations.\n\nTable 1.

These statistics highlight evolving travel preferences. Notably, there was an increase in arrivals from China and the Netherlands compared to the previous year, indicating a shift towards emerging destinations. The decrease in arrivals from Russia compared to April last year could be attributed to changes in the travel season of Russian tourists or their attraction to other tourist destinations.\n\nThe collective impact of factors such as the current peak season, improved air connections, favorable local conditions, geographical proximity, and geopolitical circumstances has greatly amplified the significance of these nations as key contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism sector.\n\nChart 1.Top ten source markets to Sri Lanka, April 2024\n\nIndia, 18%\n\nRussia,10%\n\nUnited Kingdom,\n\n9%\n\nGermany,7%\n\nFrance, 6%China, 6%Australia, 5%\n\nUnited States, 4%\n\nCanada, 2%\n\nNetherlands, 2%\n\nOther , 31%\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report April 2024\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

For instance, nations like the Maldives prioritize promoting tourism by offering visa-free entry to tourists from numerous countries, while the Schengen Area in Europe enhances diplomatic relations among member states by facilitating unrestricted travel within the zone. Economic goals, such as attracting foreign investment and addressing labor shortages, drive policies like those seen in Singapore and Germany, which offer visa-free access to foster trade, investment, and skilled migration. Moreover, initiatives like the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) promote regional integration and cooperation through visa-free travel. These policies not only improve global image and cultural exchange, as demonstrated by Iceland and Japan, but also facilitate family reunification and respond to reciprocal arrangements, as seen in the visa waiver programs of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Overall, open visa policies serve as strategic tools for countries to achieve diverse objectives on economic, diplomatic, and social fronts."

Total arrivals up to April reached 896,799.\n\nAccording to the latest UNWTO Barometer, the prospects for international tourism from May to August 2024 are generally positive, with a strong recovery anticipated. However, several factors continue to weigh on the recovery of international tourism. These include persistent economic challenges, such as inflation and high fuel prices, as well as geopolitical uncertainties. Additionally, the travel restrictions including visa requirements, low consumer confidence and COVID 19 related issues also play significant roles in influencing recovery trajectories.\n\nMonth\n\n2023\n\n2024 % Change\n\n2024/23 January 102,545 208,253 103.08\n\nFebruary 107,639 218,350 102.09\n\nMarch 125,495 209,181 66.7\n\nApril 105,498\n\n148,867 41.1\n\nMay 83,309 112,128 34.6\n\nJune 100,388\n\nJuly 143,039\n\nAugust 136,405\n\nSeptember 111,938\n\nOctober 109,199\n\nNovember 151,496\n\nDecember 210,352\n\nTOTAL\n\n1,487,303\n\n896,799\n\nTourist Arrivals | May 2024\n\n112,128\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report May 2024\n\n1\n\nTable 1.

The UK and Maldives followed at 7.2% each, while China and Germany contributed 6.7% each. These figures reflect changing travel preferences. Notably, there was an increase in arrivals from the Maldives compared to the previous year, suggesting a shift towards emerging destinations. The decline in Russian tourist arrivals compared to May last year may be due to changes in their travel season or a preference for other destinations. Additionally, the decrease in Canadian tourist arrivals could be attributed to fewer visits for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives.\n\nThe combined influence of improved air connections, favorable local conditions, geographical proximity, and geopolitical circumstances has significantly enhanced the importance of these countries as major contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism sector.\n\nChart 1.Top ten source markets to Sri Lanka, May 2024\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report May 2024\n\n5\n\nIndia28.8%\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n7.2%\n\nMaldives\n\n7.2%\n\nChina\n\n6.7%Germany\n\n6.7%\n\nAustralia\n\n4.9%\n\nRussia\n\n3.9%\n\nUnited States\n\n3.6%\n\nFrance\n\n3.6%\n\nCanada\n\n2.9%\n\nOthers\n\n24.5%\n\nTable 2.

This indicates a persistent challenge in improving the key determinants of tourism development, despite the country's rich natural and cultural resources.\n\nWhen compared to other countries in the South Asian region, Sri Lanka's ranking indicates it is lagging behind several of its neighbors. Countries such as India (39th), Indonesia (22nd), Malaysia (35th), Thailand (47th) and Vietnam (59th) typically rank higher due to their more developed tourism infrastructure and stronger policy frameworks supporting tourism. They have scored in the areas such as Prioritization of travel and tourism, price competitiveness, ICT readiness, Natural, cultural and non-leisure resources and on-air transport and infrastructure. The regional results show that Europe and Asia-Pacific regions continue to outperform, highlighting the need for Sri Lanka to adopt more robust and effective tourism policies to climb the rankings."

Additionally, improving tourist services like accommodation, transportation, and attractions can enhance satisfaction levels and encourage repeat visits. Investing in infrastructure development, including better roads, airports, and communication networks, can further support tourism growth by facilitating easier access to destinations and ensuring a smoother travel experience.\n\nBy addressing these areas of improvement, Sri Lanka can enhance its competitiveness in the global tourism market, attract more tourists, and ultimately foster sustainable growth and development in the tourism sector."

Despite this growth, the numbers remain below June 2018's figure of 146,828 and the conservative forecast of 148,695. The total arrivals up to June reached 1,010,249.\n\nAccording to the latest UNWTO Barometer, an estimated 285 million tourists traveled internationally\n\nin the first three months of 2024, marking an increase of about 20% compared to the same period in 2023. International arrivals reached 97% of 2019 levels in the first quarter of 2024, indicating a near-complete recovery to pre-pandemic figures. The positive results were driven by sustained high demand, improved air connectivity, and facilitated visa processes, as highlighted in the latest Tourism Visa Openness report. However, several factors continue to weigh on the recovery of international tourism. These include persistent economic challenges, such as inflation and high fuel prices, as well as geopolitical uncertainties (UNWTO, 2024).\n\nTable 1.

The United Kingdom and China followed with 8.2% and 7.6%, respectively, while Australia contributed 5.6%. These figures indicate shifting travel preferences. Notably, there were significant increases in visitors from Bangladesh and China compared to the previous year, indicating a trend toward emerging destinations. Conversely, declines in tourists from Russia, Canada, and Germany compared to last June may be attributed to seasonal travel changes or preferences for alternative destinations. Additionally, the reduction in Canadian arrivals could be linked to fewer visits for the purpose of seeing friends and relatives.\n\nThe enhanced significance of these countries as key contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism sector can be attributed to the combined impact of improved air connectivity, favorable local conditions, geographical proximity, and geopolitical factors.\n\nChart 1.Top ten source markets to Sri Lanka, June 2024\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report June 2024\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

By June 2024, the country had already received 1,010,249 tourists, indicating a strong upward trend in tourism. However, these numbers are still lower than the 1,164,647 tourists recorded in the same period in 2018. Monthly forecasts for 2024 show a positive trend, but actual tourist arrivals consistently fall short of these optimistic projections. When compared to 2018 figures, the number of tourists from January to June 2024 has decreased, indicating that Sri Lanka has not yet fully returned to pre-COVID levels.\n\nJanuary 2024 experienced the most substantial year-on-year increase compared to 2023, showing a remarkable rise of 103.08%. Conversely, June 2024 recorded the sharpest decline in arrivals when compared to the same month in 2018, also marking the lowest growth rate compared to 2023."

The substantial year-on-year increase in January 2024 highlights potential for recovery, but the sharp decline observed in May 2024 indicates ongoing challenges. Monthly forecasts suggest optimism, yet actual arrivals often fall short, emphasizing the need for targeted strategies to meet the ambitious target of 2.3 million tourists for the year. Addressing these challenges effectively will be crucial for sustaining and accelerating tourism growth in Sri Lanka.\n\nInternational tourist arrivals by country of residence\n\nJune 2024\n\nTourist Arrivals\n\nJune\n\n2023\n\n% Change\n\nJune (24/23)\n\n2024\n\nTotal Tourist Arrivals\n\nUp to\n\nJune 2024\n\nTotal Tourist Arrivals\n\nUp to\n\nJune\n\n2023\n\n% Change\n\nUp to\n\nJune (24/23)\n\n2024\n\nTourist Arrivals\n\nBy Air By Sea Total\n\nAMERICAS 7,680 0 7,680 8,644 (11.15) 58,694 46,566 26.0 North America 7,324 0 7,324 8,349 (12.28) 55,492 44,493 24.7\n\nCanada 3,263 0 3,263 4,509 (27.63) 22,223 22,426 (0.9) Mexico 38 0 38 34 11.76 552 301 83.4 United States 4,023 0 4,023 3,806 5.70 32,717 21,766 50.3"

The total number of arrivals by the end of July reached 1,198,059.\n\nThe latest UNWTO Barometer indicates a generally positive outlook for international tourism from May to August 2024, with strong recovery expected. However, the recovery remains constrained by various factors, including ongoing economic challenges like inflation and high fuel costs, as well as geopolitical uncertainties. Moreover, travel restrictions, including visa requirements, low consumer confidence, and lingering COVID-19 concerns, continue to impact the pace of recovery.\n\nTable 1.

Tourist arrivals by region and percentage share\n\nEurope remains a major influence on Sri Lanka's tourism, contributing 48.3% of total arrivals. At the same time, Asia and the Pacific have emerged as substantial contributors, accounting for 43.1% of visitors. This shift highlights the changing dynamics of Sri Lanka's tourism industry, with both Europe and the Asia-Pacific region playing pivotal roles.\n\nThe growth in tourism is driven by higher demand from India, the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany, which have significantly strengthened Sri Lanka's tourism sector.

China and the Netherlands followed with 6.9% and 6.1%, respectively, while Germany accounted for 5.7%. These figures highlight shifting travel preferences. Notably, there was a significant rise in arrivals from India and the Netherlands compared to the previous year, indicating a move towards emerging destinations. The decline in Canadian tourist arrivals might be linked to fewer visits for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives. The emergence of markets like the Netherlands and Switzerland, along with the absence of Russia in the top markets, is particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe synergy of better air connectivity, advantageous local conditions, close geographical proximity and geopolitical factors has markedly increased the role of these countries as key contributors to Sri Lanka's tourism industry.\n\nChart 1.Top ten source markets to Sri Lanka, July 2024\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report July 2024\n\n5\n\nIndia, 21.9%\n\nUnited Kingdom,11.1%\n\nChina, 6.9%\n\nNetherlands,\n\n6.1%\n\nGermany, 5.7%France, 5.0, %Australia, 3.9%\n\nSwitzerland, 2.7%\n\nUnited States,\n\n2.6%\n\nCanada, 2.6%\n\nOthers, 31.4%\n\nTable 2.

The primary motivation, accounting for 2.52% of visits, is leisure and vacation, highlighting the country's strong appeal as a leisure destination. Additionally, 0.19% of tourists come to reconnect with friends and family, showing Sri Lanka's attractiveness for personal gatherings. Conversely, only 0.016% of tourists visit for business, indicating a relatively minor focus on professional activities. Furthermore, 0.012% come for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) events, reflecting Sri Lanka's growing reputation as a venue for corporate events.

    "chunk_text": "Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the embarkation tax at Mattala International Airport was initially lifted. This tax was lifted again in December 2022. Landing and parking fees are waived for scheduled flights at Mattala International Airport for two years from the start. However, charter flights do not receive this benefit, and Red Wings Airlines did not qualify for this exemption as it operated charter flights. Thus, a policy decision either to extend this facility to charter flights as well or to lift the Embarkation Levy could incentivize the tourists from Russia.\n\nVisa\n\n\uf0b7 Increase Tourist Arrivals: Offering free visas makes Sri Lanka a more attractive destination, potentially increasing tourist arrivals. \uf0b7 Encourage Repeat Visits: Simplifying the visa process encourages tourists to consider Sri Lanka for repeat visits, fostering long-term tourism growth. \uf0b7 Enhance Tourist Experience: A hassle-free visa process improves the overall travel experience, making Sri Lanka more competitive compared to other destinations.\n\n13\n\nExtending the free visa facility for Russian tourists can thus play a crucial role in revitalizing and sustaining Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism sector.\n\nAcceptance of native currencies for transaction in trade and tourism\n\nRussians face challenges transacting in leading currencies, such as the dollar and euro, due to economic sanctions and banking restrictions. To mitigate these issues, it is essential to create opportunities for Russians to transact in their own currency. By allowing transactions in rubles, their spending power can significantly increase, boosting their confidence and ability to spend more freely during their travels."

To mitigate these issues, it is essential to create opportunities for Russians to transact in their own currency. By allowing transactions in rubles, their spending power can significantly increase, boosting their confidence and ability to spend more freely during their travels.\n\nWay forward\n\nTo significantly increase the number of Russian tourists visiting Sri Lanka, it's essential to implement measures that reduce the financial burden of travel. One such measure is the exemption of embarkation fees and landing and parking costs for flights, landing especially at Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, which has proven effective in the past. These financial incentives can make Sri Lanka a more attractive destination for airlines and tourists alike.\n\nExtending the visa waiver for a longer period could serve as an additional incentive to facilitate hassle-free travel for Russian tourists. Continuing the waiver would help maximize the benefits from the influx of Russian tourists.\n\nAdditionally, accepting native currencies for transactions in trade and tourism would attract more Russian tourists who face restrictions when using their own currencies.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report July 2024\n\n14\n\nInternational tourist arrivals by country of residence\n\nJuly 2024\n\nTourist Arrivals\n\nJuly 2023\n\n% Change\n\nJuly (24/23)\n\n2024\n\nTotal Tourist Arrivals\n\nUp to\n\nJuly 2024\n\nTotal Tourist Arrivals\n\nUp to\n\nJuly 2023\n\n% Change\n\nUp to\n\nJuly (24/23)\n\n2024\n\nTourist Arrivals\n\nBy Air By Sea Total\n\nAMERICAS 10,198 21 10,219 10,143 0.75 68,924 56,709 21.54 North America 9,806 21 9,827 9,901 (0.75) 65,319 54,394 20.08\n\nCanada 4,821 0 4,821 5,737 (15,97) 27,044 28,163 (3.97) Mexico 44 0 44 44 0.00 596 345 72.75 United States 4,941 21 4,962 4,120 20.44 37,679 25,886 45.56\n\nCaribbean & Central America\n\n77 0 77 37 108.11 607 359 69.08"

However, this recovery is limited by factors such as economic challenges like inflation and high fuel costs, geopolitical uncertainties, travel restrictions, visa requirements, low consumer confidence, and ongoing COVID-19 concerns, all of which continue to affect the pace of tourism's rebound.\n\nTable 1.

These figures reflect shifting travel preferences among tourists. Notably, there was a significant rise in arrivals from Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands compared to the previous year, indicating a growing interest in Sri Lanka from these emerging markets. The decline in arrivals from Russia and India may be reflecting changes in travel motivations during this period. The rise of markets like Italy and the Netherlands highlights shifting dynamics in tourist source countries, offering new opportunities for Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism sector to diversify its visitor base. This diversification helps reduce dependency on traditional markets and enhances the industry\u2019s resilience against fluctuations in specific regions.\n\nChart 1.

    "chunk_text": "Tourism is a vital component of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, contributing significantly to national income, employment, and foreign exchange earnings. The country's rich cultural heritage, natural beauty, and diverse wildlife attract millions of tourists annually. Thus, understanding the generational differences among tourists is crucial for tailoring tourism services, marketing strategies, and policy development to meet their distinct needs. These generational shifts influence the types of tourism experiences sought, spending behaviors, and expectations of service quality, which in turn impact the growth and sustainability of Sri Lanka's tourism industry.\n\nGenerational characteristics of different segments\n\nBaby Boomers\n\nGeneration X\n\nGeneration X, often balancing work and family responsibilities, has limited flexibility for travel and tends to prefer shorter trips to nearby destinations. They are generally more budget-conscious than other generations, seeking experiences that offer good value for money.\n\nHaving grown up alongside rapid technological advancements, Gen X is tech-savvy and stays current with new technologies. Unlike Baby Boomers, they tend to independently research and book their travel, relying less on travel agents and tour operators. Instead, they frequently use online travel agencies (OTAs) and review platforms like TripAdvisor for planning their trips (Acorn Tourism, 2024).\n\nMillennials\n\nThis travel group, aged 28 to 43 as of May 2024, represents a significant portion of tourism spending, prioritizing experiences over material goods. Comprising young professionals and new parents, this diverse generation is sustainability-focused and seeks unique, off-the-beaten-path destinations for authentic experiences, avoiding overly touristy spots and staged attractions."

This group, which includes gap year travelers, university students, and young professionals, has relatively lower budgets and actively seeks good deals. They prioritize sustainability and authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences. Highly tech-savvy, they rely on social media for travel inspiration, valuing recommendations from influencers and peers. They prefer booking travel components separately through online travel agencies (OTAs) and favour businesses with straightforward booking processes and a strong online presence\n\nSource: Acorn\n\nAnalysis of generational dynamics of tourists visiting to Sri Lanka\n\nAnalysis of generational dynamics of tourists visiting to Sri Lanka, January to June 2024\n\nGeneration\n\nAge Range\n\nNumber of tourists\n\nDuration of Stay\n\nBaby boomers 1946 ~ 1964 (78-60-)\n\n184,736 8.55\n\nGeneration X 1965 ~ 1980 (59 -44)\n\n226,372 8.17\n\nMillennials 1981 ~ 1996 (43-28)\n\n312,435 8.60\n\nCentennials/Z 1997 ~ 2012 (27-12)\n\n116,433 9.52\n\nGeneration Alpha 2012 on wards 12\n\n56,803 9.35\n\nTotal 896,779"

Australian and Chinese travelers typically depart from Singapore and Shanghai airports, respectively, while Dubai is a crucial departure point for visitors from Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. This highlights the importance of accessibility in bolstering Sri Lanka's tourism sector, showing how travelers' preferences for airlines and airports are influenced by their home countries. Effective travel connections and strategically positioned departure points play a key role in attracting international visitors, emphasizing the need for Sri Lanka to maintain strong links with these major transit hubs to support and enhance its tourism industry.\n\nTable 4.

This improvement may reflect Sri Lanka's ongoing efforts to boost tourism following challenges posed by the\n\npandemic and other economic difficulties in previous years.\n\nIn September, Sri Lanka's primary source markets were India, China, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia with notable increases in visitors from these countries driving the growth of the tourism sector.\n\nThe latest UNWTO Barometer presents a mostly optimistic outlook for international tourism between May and September 2024, with a strong recovery expected. However, several factors are constraining this rebound, including economic issues like inflation and high fuel prices, geopolitical instability, travel restrictions and visa requirements, low consumer confidence, and lingering concerns about COVID-19. These challenges continue to impact the speed of tourism\u2019s recovery\n\nTable 1.

These numbers highlight changing travel preferences. There was a notable increase in visitors from emerging markets such as the Maldives, Bangladesh, and Spain compared to the previous year, showing a growing interest in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the drop in arrivals from Russia and India could be attributed to evolving travel motivations or external factors influencing these markets during this period. The growing importance of markets such as the Maldives and Bangladesh underscores changing trends in tourist source countries, presenting fresh opportunities for Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry to broaden its visitor base.\n\nChart 1.

However, regenerative tourism takes this a step further by actively improving the environments and communities affected by tourism. Rather than just \"sustaining,\" regenerative tourism seeks to leave destinations better than they were before (Forbes, n.d).\n\nRegenerative tourism emphasizes the renewal of ecosystems, support for local economies, and the fostering of cultural exchanges that strengthen mutual understanding. It is particularly attractive to travelers seeking deeper, more authentic experiences in remote, lesser-known destinations. Regenerative tourism\u2019s core idea can be summed up as \u201cthe act of something growing or being grown again,\u201d with a goal to ensure that tourism acts as a positive force in restoring natural and social environments.\n\nA Framework for Regenerative Travel\n\nGlobal initiatives have been introduced to guide this shift, the most notable being the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism. Launched at COP 26 in 2021, this declaration outlines a global plan to halve tourism-related emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It calls on signatories to focus on five key areas: measuring impact, decarbonizing operations, regenerating environment s, collaborating across sectors, and securing the necessary financing to ensure long-term change [UNWTO].\n\nExamples of Regenerative Tourism in Action"

To restore and preserve its natural beauty, the government temporarily closed the island for six months, focusing on environmental rehabilitation. This initiative transformed Boracay into a cleaner, more sustainable destination for both locals and tourists. As part of the process, visitors are invited to take the \u201cOath for a Better Boracay,\u201d pledging to help maintain the island's rejuvenated state, ensuring it remains an enjoyable place to live and visit. (WTTC Travel Hub))\n\nHow Sri Lanka can adopt regenerative tourism\n\nSri Lanka, renowned for its rich biodiversity, cultural heritage, and stunning landscapes, stands in an ideal position to embrace regenerative tourism. This approach would not only protect its natural and cultural assets but also allow them to thrive and improve.\n\nRestoration of Key Natural Sites\n\nRestoring Ecosystems: Like the Philippines' Boracay Island rehabilitation, Sri Lanka could focus on regenerating its heavily visited areas, such as Sigiriya and Yala National Park. Limiting access during off-seasons could allow time for nature to heal while educating tourists on conservation efforts."

Tourists can be encouraged to stay in eco-friendly, community-run accommodations.\n\nCultural Immersion: Incorporating local culture through initiatives like homestays and community-based tourism will strengthen cultural heritage. Sri Lanka could encourage tourists to partake in traditional activities, contributing to the preservation of cultural practices.\n\nAdopting the Tiaki Promise Model\n\nSri Lanka could introduce a similar initiative to New Zealand's Tiaki Promise, where tourists commit to respecting and protecting the environment and culture. Visitors could take a pledge, promising to leave the destination in a better state than they found it.\n\nDecarbonizing Tourism Operations\n\nSustainable Transportation: Sri Lanka can adopt low-carbon transport solutions for tourists, such as electric buses in national parks and urban centers. Incentivizing eco-friendly transport and minimizing air travel within the island can significantly reduce tourism\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nRenewable Energy in Tourism: Tourism-related businesses can invest in renewable energy sources such as solar panels, reducing their reliance on fossil fuels and moving toward carbon neutrality.\n\nCollaboration with Global Initiatives"

This not only spreads the economic benefits of tourism but also relieves pressure on overburdened destinations, allowing for their regeneration.\n\nPublic and Private Sector Partnerships\n\nSri Lanka should encourage collaboration between government, businesses, and NGOs to develop regenerative tourism projects. This could include launching pilot programs that demonstrate the viability of regenerative tourism in specific regions, creating a blueprint for the rest of the country.\n\nVisitor Education and Participation\n\nCreating platforms that educate visitors on regenerative practices and involve them in local conservation activities, like beach cleanups or wildlife monitoring, would deepen their engagement and contribute to the well-being of the environment.\n\nConclusion\n\nRegenerative tourism represents an evolution in the way we think about travel and its impacts. Unlike sustainable tourism, which focuses on reducing harm, regenerative tourism seeks to improve the places travelers visit, actively restoring ecosystems, enhancing local economies, and nurturing cultural heritage. As global tourism recovers from the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift toward regenerative practices offers a vital opportunity to address environmental degradation and social inequities while fostering authentic, meaningful travel experiences. Embracing regenerative tourism not only preserves these locations for future generations but also ensures that tourism becomes a positive, restorative force for our planet and its people.\n\nReferences"

However, the rebound faces challenges from various factors, including economic pressures like inflation and high fuel costs, geopolitical instability, travel restrictions, visa requirements, low consumer confidence, and ongoing COVID-19 concerns. These hurdles continue to influence the pace of tourism\u2019s recovery.\n\nTable 1.

It aims to honour achievements across multiple categories, promoting innovation, sustainability, and excellence in service within the tourism industry. Lessons from other countries illustrate the powerful role tourism awards play in enhancing regional tourism, supporting sustainability, and safeguarding cultural heritage. For example, Spain's \"Tourism Excellence Awards\" have boosted local traditions and gastronomy, drawing niche markets. New Zealand's eco-focused tourism awards have integrated sustainable practices within the sector, aligning growth with environmental goals. Thailand's \"Amazing Thailand Tourism Awards\" have helped solidify the country\u2019s position as a global tourism leader, spotlighting unique cultural and luxury travel experiences. In Australia, the recognition of Indigenous tourism initiatives has promoted cultural preservation and provided economic benefits to Indigenous communities. Launched in 2008, the Sri Lanka Tourism Awards have the potential to fulfill several key roles.\n\nRaising Industry Standards:\n\nRecognizing accomplishments in accommodation, tourist restaurants, and specified tourist services motivates service providers to enhance the quality of their offerings.

The\n\nsignificant increase in tourist arrivals from these countries has been a key driver of growth in the sector.\n\nAccording to the UNWTO, an estimated 1.1 billion international tourist arrivals (overnight visitors) were recorded from January to September 2024, representing an 11% increase compared to the same period in 2023. International arrivals reached 98% of 2019 levels during these nine months. While international tourist arrivals are anticipated to match 2019 figures by the end of 2024, this recovery occurs within a challenging economic and geopolitical landscape.\n\nTable 1.

March, April, May, and July also experienced moderate growth, while September recorded the lowest growth rates. Overall, the year saw a 38.01% growth compared to 2023; however, there was a 12% decline when compared to 2018.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report December 2024\n\n11\n\nChallenges affecting tourism growth\n\nIntroduction of the New Visa System: The implementation of a new visa system may have caused confusion and delays, potentially deterring potential visitors.\n\nElections and Political Instability: The political climate, including elections and associated uncertainties, might have influenced travelers' decisions, leading to a decline in tourist arrivals during certain periods.\n\nTravel Warnings and Safety Concerns: Travel advisories and warnings, such as those issued regarding potential terrorist threats targeting popular tourist locations, could have deterred tourists from visiting Sri Lanka.\n\nDelays in Infrastructure Development: Ongoing infrastructure projects and delays in development may have affected the quality of services and facilities available to tourists, impacting their overall experience and potentially reducing the number of visitors.\n\nGeopolitical Factors: Regional geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainties might have influenced travelers' choices, leading them to opt for alternative destinations perceived as more stable or cost-effective.\n\nCompetition from Other Destinations: The introduction of visa-free access by competitor destinations and other marketing strategies could have attracted potential tourists away from Sri Lanka, further contributing to the shortfall in arrivals."

Enhanced air connectivity and improved visa facilitation also supported international travel. Looking ahead, international tourist arrivals are projected to grow by 3% to 5% in 2025 compared to 2024, though economic and geopolitical challenges continue to pose significant risks (UNWTO, 2025\n\nTable 1.

The Russian Federation followed with 14%, while the United Kingdom and Germany accounted for 9% and 7% respectively. The surge in visitors from countries like the Netherlands and Australia is particularly noteworthy. The growth from countries such as the Netherlands suggests a broadening of Sri Lanka's appeal, attracting tourists from a wider array of regions. The increase from Australia may be largely attributed to the diaspora visiting friends and relatives, reflecting evolving travel trends.\n\nChart 1.

Understanding these trends is crucial for stakeholders aiming to enhance the country's appeal to international tourists.\n\nAge and Gender Demographics\n\nA significant portion of tourists visiting Sri Lanka fall within the 24-35 followed by 35- 44 age group. This\n\nyouthful demographic indicates Sri Lanka's appeal to younger travelers seeking diverse experiences. As per the findings of survey conducted by Travo Trip, Millennials and Gen Z are leading the charge, making up 84% of respondents and driving trends with their appetite for exploration, community, and meaningful experiences. This global trend resonates with the findings of this survey. Contrary to the global trend where female travelers often outnumber male\u2019s majority of travelers worldwide are female (Trova trip, 2025), Sri Lanka sees a higher number of male tourists. This deviation suggests unique factors influencing male travel to the country, warranting further research to tailor marketing strategies effectively.\n\nTravel Companions and Duration"

This trend reflects a desire to reconnect with simpler times and cherished memories.\n\nPersonalized Flying\n\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence (AI), 5G connectivity, and virtual reality (VR) are enabling airlines to offer highly personalized and immersive in-flight experiences. Passengers can expect tailored content and services that cater to their individual preferences, enhancing the overall journey\n\nTrailblazer Hotels\n\nHotels are evolving into destinations themselves, offering unique identities and immersive experiences that reflect their surroundings.

Russian visitors often choose Red Wings, while Chinese travelers favour China Eastern Airlines and Air China, showing a preference for national carriers. Visitors from Poland primarily fly with Fly Dubai. Sri Lankan Airlines is a popular choice among travelers from the UK, Australia, and the United States.\n\nChennai is the main departure airport for Indian travelers, while Doha serves as the principal gateway for tourists from UK, Germany, France, the USA, and the Netherlands. Singapore, Moscow, London, and Shanghai are key transit cities for travelers from Australia, Russia, the United Kingdom, and China, respectively. These patterns highlight the importance of accessibility in promoting tourism in Sri Lanka, as travelers' airline and airport choices are influenced by their home countries.

Their contributions were instrumental in driving the increase in tourist arrivals, providing vital support to the\n\nnation's tourism industry. According to the UNWTO, international tourism experienced a significant rebound in 2024, with around 1.4 billion tourists traveling worldwide. This represents an 11% increase compared to 2023, bringing global tourism close to pre-pandemic levels. The recovery was driven by strong post-pandemic demand, solid performance from key source markets, and the continued revival of destinations in Asia and the Pacific. Improved air connectivity and easier visa processes further supported international travel. Looking forward, international tourist arrivals are expected to grow by 3% to 5% in 2025 compared to 2024, although economic and geopolitical challenges remain significant risks.\n\nTable 1.

Notably, a significant proportion of tourists from key markets such as India (49.3%), the UK (75.01%), Germany (71.62%), France (79.24%), Poland (64.61%), the United States (66.14%), and the Netherlands (74.9%) cite leisure as their primary reason for visiting.\n\nVisiting friends and relatives (VFR) is another notable motivation, particularly among tourists from the UK (12.2%), Australia (23.35%), and the US (14.29%). This reflects the strong diaspora connections and personal ties that draw visitors to the island. Additionally, there is a growing interest in Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) tourism, with 17.63% of Polish visitors and 8.51% of Indian tourists traveling for this purpose. Moreover, some German tourists (5.23%) are motivated by health and Ayurvedic tourism, highlighting Sri Lanka's emerging reputation in wellness tourism.\n\nThese diverse motivations illustrate Sri Lanka's multifaceted appeal, ranging from leisure and cultural experiences to business and wellness tourism.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report February 2025\n\n31.67\n\n75.74\n\n7.5213.697.62\n\n68.29\n\n9.54\n\n16.5911.6314.55\n\n49.30\n\n18.31\n\n75.01\n\n71.6279.24\n\n25.25\n\n61.72"

By 1855 he was leading tours to the continent and by 1866 to the United States, with his first round-the-world tour following in 18 72. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a surge in the popularity of package tours. The advent of railways and steamships made travel more accessible and affordable. Companies began offering inclusive tours that combined transportation, accommodation, and activities, catering to the growing middle class's desire to explore new destinations. Over time, package tours have evolved significantly, adapting to changing traveler preferences and technological advancements. Despite these changes, they continue to thrive, offering diverse experiences to meet the varied interests of modern tourists.\n\nPackage tourists are those who book pre-arranged travel itineraries through tour operators or travel agencies. These packages typically include flights, accommodations, transportation, and guided tours, offering a hassle-free experience for travelers.\n\nAdvantages for Sri Lanka:\n\n1. Economic Impact:\n\no Package tourists often spend more on high-end accommodations, guided tours, and curated\n\nexperiences, contributing significantly to the local economy.\n\no Their spending is more predictable and concentrated in specific areas, making it easier for\n\nbusinesses to plan and optimize their services. 2. Ease of Management:\n\no Package tourists follow structured itineraries, which helps distribute tourist traffic across key"

Promotion of Lesser-Known Destinations:\n\no Tour operators often include off-the-beaten-path destinations in their packages,\n\nhelping to promote underdeveloped regions and distribute economic benefits more evenly. 4. Higher Spending on Local Services:\n\no Package tourists are more likely to use local guides, drivers, and other services\n\nincluded in their packages, directly supporting local livelihoods.\n\nChallenges:\n\n1. Limited Flexibility:\n\no Package tourists may have less freedom to explore independently, which can limit their\n\nexposure to local culture and smaller businesses. 2. Environmental Impact:\n\no Concentrated tourist flows to popular destinations can lead to environmental degradation if\n\nnot managed sustainably.\n\nNon-Package Tourists: Independent and Exploratory Except for few key markets such as India, China, Poland and Russia travelers to Sri Lanka are predominantly free independent travelers (FITs) Non-package tourists, often referred to as independent or backpacker travelers, plan their trips without pre-arranged itineraries. They tend to seek authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences and often stay longer in the country.\n\nAdvantages for Sri Lanka:\n\n1. Economic Diversification:\n\no Independent travelers often spend money on local businesses, such as small guesthouses,\n\nstreet food vendors, and local transport, spreading economic benefits more widely. o Their spending patterns support micro-entrepreneurs and informal sectors, which are crucial\n\nfor inclusive economic growth. 2.

Both types of travelers bring unique benefits and challenges, and Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism strategy should aim to leverage the strengths of each while mitigating their drawbacks.\n\n1. Targeting High-Value Package Tourists:\n\nSri Lanka should focus on attracting high-value package tourists who contribute significantly to the economy while ensuring that their itineraries include sustainable practices and support for local communities. 2.

Encouraging Independent Travelers:\n\nBoth types of travelers should be encouraged to adopt sustainable practices, such as supporting eco-friendly accommodations, respecting local cultures, and minimizing environmental impact. 4. Diversifying Tourism Offerings: Sri Lanka should diversify its tourism offerings to cater to both package and non-package tourists. This includes developing niche markets such as adventure tourism, wellness tourism, and cultural tourism.\n\nConclusion\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry stands to benefit significantly from both package and non-package tourists. Package tourists bring structured, high-value contributions to the economy, while independent travelers foster cultural exchange and support local businesses. By adopting a balanced approach, Sri Lanka can maximize the benefits of both types of travelers while promoting sustainable and inclusive growth.

However, uncertainties remain regarding traditionally low seasons and global economic factors. To maintain this positive trajectory, strategic priorities should include sustained marketing efforts, targeted promotions during expected seasonal dips, and infrastructure improvements.\n\nKey source markets including India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France played a crucial role in strengthening Sri Lanka's tourism performance in March. These markets made substantial contributions that drove the growth in visitor numbers, providing essential support to the country's tourism sector.\n\nTable 1.

These underserved regions offer distinct potential: the Middle East for high-end tourism, Africa for environmental experiences, and the Americas for specialized interests such as wildlife observation.\n\nTo reduce vulnerability to regional economic fluctuations and build a more sustainable tourism sector, Sri Lanka should focus on broadening its visitor base through improved flight connections, streamlined visa regulations, and targeted marketing initiatives specific to each underrepresented region. Addressing these imbalances could stimulate growth while creating a more resilient tourism ecosystem less susceptible to localized market disruptions.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report March 2025\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTop primary markets and top potential markets\n\nTop primary markets, March 2025\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report March 2025\n\n1\n\nIndia\n\nArrivals: 39,212 / % Share: 17.1\n\n01\n\nRussia Arrivals: 29,177 / % Share: 12.7\n\n02\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nArrivals: 22,447 / % Share: 9.8\n\n03\n\nGermany\n\nArrivals: 17,918 / % Share: 7.8\n\n04\n\nFrance Arrivals: 15,278 / % Share: 6.7\n\n05\n\nChina\n\nArrivals: 11,114 / % Share: 4.8\n\nAustralia\n\nArrivals: 9,012 / % Share: 3.9\n\nUnited States Arrivals: 7,676 / % Share: 3.3\n\nIsrael Arrivals: 2,069 / % Share: 0.9\n\nMalaysia Arrivals: 2,256 / % Share: 1.0\n\nCzech Republic\n\nArrivals: 2,266 / % Share: 1.0\n\nSpain Arrivals: 2,548 / % Share: 1.1\n\nSwitzerland Arrivals: 2,740 / % Share: 1.2\n\nIran Arrivals: 3,695 / % Share: 1.6\n\nJapan Arrivals: 3,708 / % Share: 1.6\n\nCanada Arrivals: 4,219 / % Share: 1.8\n\nBangladesh Arrivals: 4,713 / % Share: 2.1"

To maximize these trends, Sri Lanka should enhance flight connections with high-performing markets, develop targeted promotional strategies for underperforming regions like China, and invest in cruise tourism facilities.\n\nThese insights highlight the importance of a balanced approach that nurtures traditional European markets while simultaneously developing emerging opportunities across Asia and Eastern Europe, addressing market-specific challenges to foster sustainable tourism development.\n\nChart 1.

For instance: \u2022 Costa Rica: The Certificate for Sustainable Tourism (CST) program applies to\n\nattractions and natural areas, not just accommodations, providing a holistic approach to destination development. \u2022 Singapore has a highly structured approach to attraction development, with its\n\nIntegrated Resorts, Gardens by the Bay, and Sentosa Island adhering to rigorous quality and service standards, enhancing the overall visitor experience. \u2022 China's tourist attraction rating system categorizes attractions into five levels (A to\n\nAAAAA), with AAAAA being the highest, based on criteria like quality, management, and uniqueness, overseen by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism \u2022 The Japan Sustainable Tourism Standard for Destinations (JSTS-D) was developed\n\nas Japan's national approach to sustainable destination management.\n\nBy adopting similar structured approaches, Sri Lanka can ensure that its attractions are well-developed, properly managed, and provide high-quality experiences that meet international standards."

These guidelines provide comprehensive criteria for sustainable destination management, cultural heritage protection, environmental conservation, and community involvement. Implementing GSTC standards for Sri Lankan attractions would:\n\n\u2022 Ensure environmental responsibility by minimizing the ecological footprint of tourism\n\nactivities. \u2022 Improve visitor experience through better facilities, interpretation, and accessibility. \u2022 Promote responsible tourism by engaging local communities in conservation and\n\ntourism-related benefits. \u2022 Enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness as a sustainable tourism destination. Recently, Sigiriya was awarded the Bronze Level Certification by Green Destinations, signifying its commitment to sustainability. This success can be replicated across other major attractions, creating a network of standardized and sustainably managed sites that elevate Sri Lanka\u2019s global tourism profile. The role of attraction management and Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) One of the key challenges in Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism landscape is the fragmented ownership and management of attractions. Many tourist sites fall under the purview of multiple government departments and institutions, resulting in uncoordinated efforts and inefficiencies. Unlike in other countries where dedicated Attraction Management Organizations (AMOs) or Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) oversee attractions holistically, Sri Lanka lacks a unified approach to managing its sites."

Middle Eastern airlines form the second-most significant group, with Qatar Airways (10.77%), Emirates (10.34%), and Etihad Airways (6.84%) collectively bringing 28.25% of travelers through their strategic hubs in Doha, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi, which serve as essential transit points for long-haul passengers from Europe and beyond. The Indian market shows strong representation through Indigo (8.23%) and Air India (4.29%), reflecting the importance of proximity and cultural connections driving regional travel demand. Russian carriers Red Wings Airlines (4.78%) and Aeroflot (2.54%) indicate a growing niche segment from Russia likely linked to seasonal tourism, while Asian airlines including China Eastern (2.37%), Singapore Airlines (2.04%), and Air Asia (1.66%) point to developing opportunities in East and Southeast Asian markets. A diverse mix of smaller carriers comprises 10.11% of arrivals, suggesting potential for further market diversification. These patterns emphasize the importance of maintaining Sri Lankan Airlines' strong position, nurturing partnerships with Gulf carriers, expanding cooperation with Indian and Southeast Asian airlines, and strategically engaging with emerging market carriers to enhance tourism resilience and growth potential.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report March 2025\n\n1\n\n15\n\nChart 6.

    "chunk_text": "An examination of airline preferences across Sri Lanka's key tourist markets reveals distinctive travel patterns and connectivity dynamics. India, the primary source market, heavily utilizes Sri Lankan Airlines (39.68%) and Indigo (36.18%), with Indian carriers collectively handling 91.75% of arrivals, highlighting the importance of direct regional flights and cultural connections. Russian travelers predominantly fly with Red Wings Airlines (36.18%) and Aeroflot (19.52%), which together account for nearly 56% of arrivals, complemented by Air Arabia (13.13%) serving as an important transit option, reflecting Russia's charter-focused travel patterns.\n\nThe United States and Poland exhibit fragmented airline usage patterns indicating diverse transit options and opportunities for targeted aviation partnerships. These patterns highlight the strategic importance of fostering regional carrier relationships for short-haul markets, strengthening alliances with Middle Eastern airlines for European connectivity, developing specialized partnerships for charter-driven markets like Russia, and exploring new direct routes to address connectivity gaps in fragmented markets, thereby enhancing Sri Lanka's accessibility as a global tourism destination.\n\nTable 4.

These countries made significant contributions to the surge in visitor arrivals, providing vital support and driving the overall growth in the industry during this period.\n\nTable 1.

The relatively low figures from the Middle East and Africa may reflect limited direct flights, or less targeted marketing.\n\nThe heavy reliance on Europe and Asia & Pacific suggests that Sri Lanka\u2019s marketing and connectivity are strongest in these regions. However, this also means the industry is vulnerable to economic or political changes in these markets. Diversifying source markets-especially by increasing promotion and improving air links with the Americas, Middle East, and Africa-could help stabilize and grow overall tourist arrivals. Tailored marketing campaigns, improved flight connectivity, and targeted travel incentives could help attract more visitors from these underrepresented regions.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report April 2025\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTop primary markets and top potential markets\n\nTop primary markets, April 2025\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report April 2025\n\n1\n\nIndia\n\nArrivals: 38,744 / % Share: 22.2\n\n01\n\nUnited Kingdom Arrivals: 17,348 / % Share: 9.9\n\n02\n\nRussia Arrivals: 13,525 / % Share: 7.7\n\n03\n\nGermany\n\nArrivals: 11,654 / % Share: 6.7\n\n04\n\nAustralia Arrivals: 10,744 / % Share: 6.2\n\n05\n\nChina\n\nArrivals: 8,667 / % Share: 5.0\n\nFrance\n\nArrivals: 8,276/ % Share: 4.7\n\nBangladesh Arrivals: 5,428 / % Share: 3.1\n\nMalaysia Arrivals: 1,486 / % Share: 0.9\n\nBelgium Arrivals: 1,623 / % Share: 0.9\n\nIsrael\n\nArrivals: 1,821 / % Share: 1.0\n\nPoland Arrivals: 2,098 / % Share: 1.2\n\nJapan Arrivals: 2,374 / % Share: 1.4\n\nSpain Arrivals: 3,144 / % Share: 1.8\n\nCanada Arrivals: 3,238 / % Share: 1.9"

However, arrivals by sea, while a smaller proportion, are not insignificant for certain markets. For example, India saw 540 arrivals by sea, the highest among all countries, followed by the United States (339), Australia (88), the United Kingdom (55), and the Netherlands (24). This suggests that cruise tourism and ferry connections, especially with nearby countries like India, are contributing to the overall tourism numbers and have room for further development.\n\nChart 1.

Etihad Airways (7%), Fly Dubai (3%), and Air Arabia (3%) further reinforce the role of Gulf-based airlines as key connectors.\n\nEuropean and Russian airlines, including Red Wings Airlines (3%), & Aeroflot (2%), indicate a notable influx of tourists from Russia. The presence of Turkish Airlines (3%) and Singapore Airlines (2%) highlights Sri Lanka\u2019s direct links to both Europe and Southeast Asia.\n\nOther Asian carriers such as China Eastern Airline (2%), Cathay Pacific (2%) illustrate the growing, though still modest, contribution of East Asian markets. AirAsia (2%) and FITS Air (1%) also add to the diversity of carriers serving Sri Lanka.

Top ten markets vs. main last departure airports to Sri Lanka, April\n\nAn analysis of last departure airports among Sri Lanka\u2019s key source markets reveals distinct connectivity patterns that shape inbound tourism. India, the leading contributor with 38,744 arrivals, relies heavily on direct regional routes, as Chennai (11,816), Bangalore (8,437), and Mumbai (6,816) together account for nearly two-thirds of Indian visitors. This underscores the dominance of short-haul, direct connections for the Indian market, facilitating ease of travel and high volumes.\n\nIn contrast, Russian travelers (13,525 arrivals) predominantly depart via Moscow (4,028), but also utilize Middle Eastern hubs like Sharjah (2,062) and Abu Dhabi (1,597), reflecting limited direct connectivity and a reliance on charter services or Gulf carriers. European source markets, such as\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report April 2025\n\n18\n\n17\n\nthe United Kingdom (17,348 arrivals) and Germany (11,654 arrivals), demonstrate a strong dependence on Middle Eastern transit points. British and German tourists frequently route through Dubai (3,292 and 2,541, respectively), Doha (3,010 and 2,137), and Abu Dhabi, while London remains a significant direct gateway for the UK (4,219)."

The strategic importance of airports in Dubai, Doha, and Singapore is evident, suggesting that optimizing partnerships and connectivity through these hubs could further enhance Sri Lanka\u2019s appeal to long-haul travelers. Additionally, the reliance on unconventional routes and specialized transit points may represent opportunities for targeted marketing and route development to capture niche tourism segments.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report April 2025\n\n18\n\nResearch & International Relations Division\n\n011 2426800 Ext. 151/155\n\nresearch@srilanka.travel\n\nwww.sltda.gov.lk\n\n1"

This signifies an exceptionally strong and consistent inbound flow, likely driven by geographical proximity, cultural ties, and robust air connectivity. While this provides a strong foundation for Sri Lanka's tourism, such heavy reliance on a single market also presents a vulnerability; any significant negative shifts in Indian outbound travel could disproportionately impact overall arrivals.\n\nFollowing India, the market share distribution becomes more fragmented. The United Kingdom (6.9%) and China (6.6%) are the next significant contributors, collectively accounting for around 13.5% of arrivals.\n\nBangladesh (5.5%), Germany (5.4%), and Australia (4.5%) form a mid-tier group of contributors. The consistent presence of Germany indicates a mature European market, often associated with higher-spending tourists and specialized interests (as seen in the \"Health/Ayurvedic\" purpose). Bangladesh's strong showing points to robust regional connections and perhaps a growing outbound travel market. Australia, as a long-haul market, signifies successful efforts in attracting visitors especially for VFR purposes despite the greater distance."

This strong showing from Indian airports directly correlates with India's position as one of Sri Lanka's top source markets.\n\nAn analysis of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka by airlines/ cruise lines reveals a clear hierarchy of carriers facilitating inbound tourism. Sri Lankan Airlines, as the national carrier, naturally leads with a dominant 27% of arrivals, demonstrating its crucial role in connecting the country to global markets. This is followed by a strong presence from Indian carriers, with indigo accounting for 19% and Air India for 9%, collectively highlighting the significant volume of Indian tourists arriving in Sri Lanka. This strong performance by Indian airlines is consistent with India being a top source market for Sri Lanka.\n\nMiddle Eastern airlines also play a substantial role, with Emirates (7%), Qatar Airways (7%), Etihad Airways (6%), and Fly Dubai (2%) collectively channeling a considerable number of travelers, leveraging their extensive international networks to connect passengers from various continents. China Eastern Airlines (3.31%) shows a notable contribution from the Chinese market, while Singapore Airlines (2.23%) and Turkish Airlines (1.99%) provide further connectivity from Southeast Asia and Europe/Middle East, respectively.\n\nSmaller, but still significant, contributions come from Fits Air (1.93%), Air Arabia (1.85%), Aida stella (1.52%), Air Asia (1.33%), Cathay Pacific (1.29%), Thai Air Asia (0.98%), Malaysia Airlines (0.98%), and Aeroflot (0.94%). This airline-specific data is invaluable for strategic engagement with carriers, identifying opportunities for route expansion, and coordinating marketing efforts to maximize passenger loads and facilitate seamless travel to Sri Lanka\n\n1 14"

This pattern underscores the robust direct and frequent flight options available from various parts of India.\n\nChinese tourists primarily depart from Shanghai (2,645 arrivals), but a substantial number also originate from regional hubs such as Kuala Lumpur (454), Singapore (358), and Bangkok (306), indicating a mixed reliance on direct flights and connections through Southeast Asian gateways. For Bangladesh, Dhaka is a significant departure point (1,709), as anticipated, but Chennai (1,474) and Delhi (1,533) also play roles, reflecting a combination of direct flights and regional connections.\n\nLong-haul markets also exhibit distinct patterns. Australian visitors primarily use Singapore (1,859) and Melbourne (1507) as their last departure airports, indicating a strong reliance on Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern transit hubs. Tourists from the United States frequently utilize Doha (692), Dubai (288), and Abu Dhabi (458) as key transit points, alongside Singapore (222), underscoring multi-leg journeys often involving Middle Eastern and Asian hubs.

Finally, for the Russian Federation, Moscow (1,247) serves as a primary departure point, complemented by Sharjah (681) as a direct or connecting hub, reflecting direct flights or connections through the UAE."

United Kingdom tourists show a strong preference for Sri Lankan Airlines (40.88%), followed by Qatar Airways (19.44%), with Etihad Airways (10.83%) also having a notable presence. This indicates a reliance on a mix of direct flights and connecting services through Middle Eastern hubs.\n\nFrance presents an interesting dynamic, with Emirates (32.45%) and Qatar Airways (19.03%) being the leading airlines, underscoring the strong role of Middle Eastern carriers as connecting points from Europe. Sri Lankan Airlines (13.86%) also holds a notable share. United States tourists predominantly use Middle Eastern carriers for their journey, with Qatar Airways (19.10%), and Etihad Airways (12.53%) being key. Sri Lankan Airlines (17.33%) also contributes, likely facilitating connections. Similarly, Canada also relies heavily on Middle Eastern airlines, with Emirates (21.66%) and Etihad Airways (17.88%) as major carriers, alongside Sri Lankan Airlines (34.11%). Finally, for the Russian Federation, Aeroflot (36.42%) is the primary airline, indicating a direct or preferred route. Air Arabia (20.46%) also plays a significant role, suggesting connections through Sharjah.\n\nThis airline-specific market breakdown is invaluable for understanding the competitive landscape of air travel to Sri Lanka. It allows for targeted collaboration with leading airlines from each source market, identification of potential new route opportunities, and the development of joint marketing initiatives to enhance tourist flow and accessibility.\"\n\n18\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report May 2025\n\nResearch & International Relations Division"

With this momentum, Sri Lanka is well-positioned to exceed the total arrivals recorded in 2024 (2,053,465) by the end of 2025, marking a strong recovery and continued growth for the tourism sector.\n\nKey source markets such as India, the United Kingdom, China, Australia, and Pakistan have played a crucial role in revitalizing Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism sector during the month of June. Their strong contributions have been vital in boosting tourist arrivals and sustaining the overall growth of the industry during this period.\n\nTable 1.

This strong performance can be attributed to close regional connections, proximity, and cultural affinity, which collectively make Sri Lanka a convenient and attractive destination for travelers from this part of the world.\n\nIn comparison, the Americas accounted for 10,127 visitors (7.3%), while arrivals from the Middle East and Africa were more modest, totaling 3,479 (2.5%) and 1,737 (1.3%) respectively. This distribution highlights Sri Lanka\u2019s current reliance on a limited number of key regions, with relatively low engagement from others. Nonetheless, it also signals a promising opportunity to expand into underrepresented markets.\n\nThe sustained high arrival numbers from Asia & Pacific and Europe can be attributed to steady travel demand, robust air connectivity, cultural appeal, and attractive travel packages. In contrast, the lower figures from the Middle East and Africa may stem from limited direct flight options, reduced marketing outreach, or lower awareness of Sri Lanka as a travel destination. This regional concentration reveals a level of vulnerability, especially if disruptions impact the dominant source markets.\n\nTo address this and support long-term, sustainable growth, Sri Lanka would benefit from diversifying its tourism base. Initiatives such as expanding flight connectivity, launching targeted marketing campaigns, and providing tailored travel incentives could enhance visibility and interest in less-tapped regions like the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa\u2014fostering a more balanced and resilient tourism industry.\n\n2\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report June 2025\n\nTop primary markets and top potential markets\n\nTop primary markets, June 2025\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n1\n\nIndia\n\nArrivals: 37,934 / % Share: 27.4\n\n01"

Overall, this distribution highlights Sri Lanka\u2019s growing appeal across both regional and long-haul markets. However, the decline from China and continued dependence on a few key regions also signals the need for diversification. Strategic focus on underrepresented but growing markets like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and North America could help build a more balanced and resilient tourism sector.\n\nChart 1.

Bangladesh emerges as the most\n\nleisure-focused market with an exceptional 80.67% of visitors coming for pleasure and\n\nvacation purposes, followed by Germany (60.60%) and India (56.08%), indicating these\n\nmarkets view Sri Lanka primarily as a holiday destination with strong appeal for its\n\nbeaches, cultural heritage, and natural attractions. Visiting friends and relatives\n\ndominates the Canadian market with a remarkable 62.75% of visitors, followed by the\n\nUnited Kingdom (33.41%) and Australia (30.15%), reflecting the strong Sri Lankan\n\ndiaspora communities in these countries and the importance of family and social\n\nconnections in driving tourism from Commonwealth nations. Religious tourism shows\n\nstriking variations, with Pakistan leading at 39.46% due to the Bohra conference that is\n\nbeing held in Sri Lanka, followed by the United States (11.36%) and Canada (4.60%),\n\nwhile most European markets show minimal religious travel motivations.

Sri Lankan Airlines emerges as the dominant carrier, accounting for 27.85% of total arrivals (38,495 passengers), indicating its central role in facilitating inbound travel, likely due to its extensive regional network and national carrier advantage. Indigo follows with 12.49%, reflecting the strong air connectivity and traveler flow between India and Sri Lanka. Major Gulf carriers such as Emirates (10.13%), Etihad Airways (8.56%), and Qatar Airways (7.35%) also play a significant role, highlighting the importance of the Middle Eastern hubs as key transit points for long-haul travelers. Other notable contributors include Air India (6.20%), Fly Dubai (3.50%), and Air Arabia (3.06%), further reinforcing the prominence of Indian and Gulf-based carriers. The presence of Chinese and Southeast Asian airlines like China Eastern, Singapore Airlines, and Malaysia Airlines, although smaller in share, suggests emerging or niche travel corridors. The wide spread across 20+ airlines, including budget carriers like Air Asia and Thai Air Asia, indicates a diversified aviation landscape and a mix of travel purposes \u2014 from business and leisure to visiting friends and relatives (VFR). This analysis suggests that maintaining strong bilateral air agreements and route expansions, particularly with India, the Middle East, and East Asia, will be crucial for sustaining and growing tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka.\n\n1 17\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report June 2025\n\nChart 6.

This indicates that Indian tourists tend to travel directly via major Indian cities, supported by proximity, frequency of flights, and possibly VFR and business ties.\n\nThe United Kingdom (11,628) shows a significant concentration via London (3,643) and Middle Eastern hubs like Abu Dhabi (1,739) and Dubai (1,563), which are commonly used transit points for long-haul European travelers. This suggests that connecting flights through the Gulf play a critical role in facilitating arrivals from Western countries."

Likewise, Bangladesh (5,826) has strong routing through Dhaka (2,115) and Male (1,648), revealing a more regionally networked route via South Asia.\n\nFor Germany (5,498), arrivals are mainly split between Abu Dhabi (1,397) and Dubai (1,371), confirming again the Middle East as a vital corridor for European markets.\n\nIn the case of the United States (5,422), multiple entry points are utilized, but there is a notable number through Doha (1,077), Dubai (728) which aligns with typical transit routes via the Gulf.\n\nFrance (4,345) and Canada (4,293) also show strong reliance on Gulf hubs such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Doha, while Canada also sees notable movement via Abu Dhabi (965) and Dubai (730).\n\nThis data highlights the central role of Middle Eastern hubs like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Doha as critical transit points for Western and South Asian tourists, while regional connectivity through Indian cities dominates travel from neighboring South Asian countries. East and Southeast Asian hubs like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, and Hong Kong are especially significant for travelers from China and Australia. These insights are crucial in planning route development, marketing strategies, and bilateral tourism partnerships.\n\n19"

However, beneath the surface of wildlife safaris and elephant encounters lies a deepening crisis that threatens not only these magnificent creatures but also the sustainable future of Sri Lankan tourism.\n\nThe Tourism Draw: Elephants as Economic Assets\n\nElephants have been integral to Sri Lanka's tourism appeal for decades. The island nation, home to approximately 7,000 Asian elephants, offers visitors unique opportunities to witness these giants in their natural habitat across renowned national parks such as Yala, Udawalawe, Minneriya, and Wilpattu. Wildlife tourism, with elephants as a primary attraction, represents a significant component of Sri Lanka's tourism revenue, drawing thousands of international visitors annually who seek authentic wildlife experiences.\n\nThe Escalating Death Crisis\n\nBehind this tourism success story, however, lies an alarming reality that threatens the very foundation of elephant based tourism. Sri Lanka is experiencing unprecedented elephant mortality rates that have reached crisis proportions in recent years.\n\nThe statistics paint a sobering picture with staggering number of deaths recorded each year. The trend appears to be continuing into 2025, with reports indicating the grave side of this phenomenon."

The trend appears to be continuing into 2025, with reports indicating the grave side of this phenomenon.\n\nThe Tourism Industry's Dilemma\n\nThis escalating elephant mortality crisis presents a paradoxical challenge for Sri Lanka's tourism industry. While tourists continue to flock to the island seeking elephant encounters, the very attractions they come to see are disappearing at an alarming rate. The loss of iconic tuskers, the large male elephants with prominent tusks that are particularly popular with tourists has been especially devastating for wildlife viewing experiences.\n\nThe tourism industry finds itself in a difficult position, profiting from elephant attractions while the species faces potential local extinction. Some tourism operators have begun advocating for more sustainable practices and supporting conservation initiatives, recognizing that their long term business viability depends on healthy elephant populations.\n\n.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report July 2025\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report- July 2025\n\n12\n\nEconomic Implications and Future Outlook\n\nThe economic implications of the elephant crisis extend far beyond conservation concerns. The potential collapse of elephant populations could severely impact Sri Lanka's tourism industry, which relies heavily on wildlife attractions to differentiate itself in the competitive South Asian tourism market."

This includes,\n\nStrengthening Legal Protections: Enforcing existing wildlife protection laws more effectively and implementing stricter penalties for elephant killing, while simultaneously addressing the root causes that drive people to harm elephants.\n\nExpanding Compensation and Support Systems: Developing more comprehensive and accessible compensation schemes for crop damage, combined with support for alternative agricultural practices that are less attractive to elephants.\n\nTourism Revenue Sharing: Establishing mechanisms to ensure that a greater proportion of tourism revenue flows directly to local communities affected by human elephant conflict, creating economic incentives for conservation.\n\nEducation and Awareness: Promoting greater awareness among both local communities and tourists about the importance of elephant conservation and the actions needed to ensure coexistence."

Middle Eastern airports emerge as the primary gateways, with Dubai leading at 14.50%, followed by Doha at 12.70% and Abu Dhabi at 8.78%. Combined, these three hubs handle more than one third of all tourist departures, demonstrating the pivotal role of Gulf carriers, Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad in linking Sri Lanka to global markets across Europe, North America, and Africa.\n\nIndian airports represent the second largest departure cluster, collectively managing over 22% of outbound traffic. Chennai tops the Indian gateways at 7.53%, with Delhi (4.67%), Mumbai (4.40%), Bangalore (3.38%), and Hyderabad (2.04%) following as significant departure points. This pattern confirms India's dual role as both a primary tourist source and a crucial transit corridor for travelers from other countries accessing Sri Lanka."

Gulf carriers have achieved collective dominance across European markets, controlling approximately 70% of passenger traffic from the UK, Netherlands, and Germany. Qatar Airways demonstrates particular strength in the Spanish market with 28.64% share. However, the UK market presents a unique competitive landscape where market share is relatively balanced among three major carriers: Sri Lankan Airlines (26.49%), Emirates (21.99%), and Qatar Airways (22.26%).\n\nChinese travelers show strong preference for domestic carriers, with China Eastern commanding 33.15% and Air China holding 10.08% of the market. In addition, Sri Lankan Airlines (15.93%) and Cathay Pacific (15.11%) are the other key airlines used by Chinese tourists. Meanwhile, Australian passengers predominantly choose Sri Lankan Airlines (54.49%) alongside Singapore Airlines (23.25%) as their preferred carriers."

Meanwhile, Australian passengers predominantly choose Sri Lankan Airlines (54.49%) alongside Singapore Airlines (23.25%) as their preferred carriers.\n\nThese patterns reveal distinct regional preferences and strategic dependencies. European travelers demonstrate overwhelming reliance on Gulf hub connectivity for reaching Sri Lanka, while other markets favour either direct services (such as Sri Lankan's routes to Australia and Canada) or regional low-cost carriers (like IndiGo's strong Indian market presence).\n\nSri Lanka's tourism connectivity relies heavily on regional transit hubs, with clear geographic patterns emerging. For European travelers (UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain), Gulf airports dominate as transit points: Dubai, Doha, and Abu Dhabi collectively account for 52-66%, underscoring their role as critical gateways for long haul traffic. Conversely, Indian tourists arrive primarily via direct flights from domestic airports, with Chennai (33%), Bangalore (15%), Delhi (12%), Mumbai (13%), and Hyderabad (10%) together representing 83% of departures demonstrating minimal reliance on intermediate hubs.

Their continued engagement reflects effective targeted marketing, restored travel confidence, and possibly strengthened diplomatic and air travel ties. This diversified market base not only boosts arrival numbers but also reduces seasonal and economic dependency on any single region, supporting a more resilient and sustainable growth path for the industry.\n\nTable 1.

Six of the top ten source nations are European, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and the Netherlands, collectively contributing over 70,000 tourists. More importantly, these markets are exhibiting exceptionally strong growth rates, with Italy (27.8%), France (22.1%), and Spain (21.8%) leading the charge. This powerful rebound suggests that Sri Lanka remains a highly attractive long-haul destination for European travelers.\n\nThe performance of other Asian markets presents a more nuanced picture. China, holding the fourth position, showed only a modest 1.7% growth. This suggests a slower than expected recovery of Chinese outbound travel post pandemic or a potential shift in travel preferences away from traditional packages. In contrast, Japan, though in tenth place, recorded the highest percentage growth among all top markets at 25%, signalling a promising and expanding interest from this high spending demographic. The consistent presence of Australia in the top ten further confirms Sri Lanka's appeal across diverse long haul markets.\n\nThe strategic implications for Sri Lanka are clear. While continuing to nurture and expand its vital partnership with India, it is vital to diversify its portfolio. Capitalizing on the booming European demand is essential, but so is fostering the recovery of the Chinese market and locking in the emerging interest from Japan and other regions. This data ultimately paints a picture of a successful recovery, built on a foundation of strong traditional markets while revealing opportunities for future growth and stability.\n\nChart 1.

While these categories contribute minimally at present, they offer opportunities for growth if strategically developed, given Sri Lanka\u2019s strengths in wellness, cultural heritage, sports events, and academic exchanges.\n\nOverall, the analysis suggests that Sri Lanka remains predominantly a leisure destination,\n\nthough diaspora related travel and MICE tourism also play significant roles. The smaller segments remain underutilized but provide scope for diversification of the tourism product base. While reinforcing the country\u2019s leisure appeal, greater emphasis should be placed on diversifying into high value niche markets such as wellness, religious, sports, and education tourism, alongside strengthening diaspora linkages and MICE opportunities.\n\nChart 4: Purpose of visit, August 2025\n\n9\n\nPleasure/\n\nVacation\n\n59%Other or not\n\nresponded\n\n20%\n\nVisiting friends and\n\nrelatives\n\n11%\n\nMICE\n\n8%\n\nBusiness\n\n2%\n\nHealth/Ayurvedic\n\n0.34%\n\nReligious\n\n0.28%Sports\n\n0.12%\n\nEducation\n\n0.12%\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report August 2025\n\nChart 5: Purpose of visit vs main source markets"

The island nation reached its tourism zenith in 2018, only to face unprecedented challenges in subsequent years. Understanding the path from peak performance to recovery provides crucial insights into the resilience of Sri Lanka's tourism sector and the broader implications for the country's economic stability.\n\nThe Golden Year: 2018 Tourism Peak\n\nIn 2018, Sri Lanka's tourism industry achieved remarkable success, recording exactly 2,333,796 tourist arrivals. This represented the highest number of international arrivals in the country's tourism history, establishing the benchmark for all future recovery efforts. These visitors contributed significantly to the economy, spending a total of US$4.3 billion in the country."

This represented the highest number of international arrivals in the country's tourism history, establishing the benchmark for all future recovery efforts. These visitors contributed significantly to the economy, spending a total of US$4.3 billion in the country.\n\nThe Decline and Challenges (2019-2022)\n\nSri Lanka's tourism success story faced severe disruptions beginning in 2019. Tourist arrivals plummeted to 1,913,702 an 18% decline from the 2018 peak following the Easter Sunday bombings in April 2019. This marked the beginning of a prolonged period of decline that would test the industry's resilience.\n\nThe situation deteriorated dramatically with the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic. In 2020, tourist arrivals collapsed to just 507,704 visitors, representing a catastrophic 78.3% drop from 2018 levels and a 73.5% decline from the already reduced 2019 numbers. The pandemic brought international travel to a virtual standstill.\n\nThe industry hit its lowest point in 2021, with only 194,495 arrivals, a staggering 91.7% decline from 2018 and a further 61.7% drop from 2020. This represented less than one twelfth of the peak 2018 arrivals, highlighting the devastating impact of prolonged border closures and travel restrictions.\n\nRecovery began tentatively in 2022, with arrivals increasing to 719,978 a remarkable 270.1% increase from 2021, though still 69.1% below 2018 levels. The economic crisis that engulfed Sri\n\nLanka in 2022 complicated recovery efforts, creating additional barriers through infrastructure challenges, fuel shortages, and negative international perception.\n\nThe Recovery Phase: 2023 Analysis"

With 1,487,303 arrivals representing 36.3% below 2018 levels, Sri Lanka had recovered.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report August 2025\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report- August 2025\n\n12\n\napproximately 63.7% of its peak tourism performance. This meant that nearly 846,493 fewer tourists visited Sri Lanka in 2023 compared to the record year of 2018.\n\nThe 2023 recovery showed that while the acute crisis phase had passed, the industry still required significant effort to return to pre crisis performance levels.

    "chunk_text": "This progression indicates that while dramatic growth rates were unsustainable, Sri Lanka has maintained positive momentum sufficient to approach and potentially exceed 2018 levels.\n\nRecent Progress and Future Outlook\n\nThe 2024 performance demonstrates that Sri Lanka is on a clear trajectory toward full recovery. The year over year growth rates tell a compelling story: from 270.9% growth in 2022 (off a very low base), to 106.6% growth in 2023, to 38% growth in 2024, showing sustained momentum despite the decreasing growth rates as the base numbers increase.\n\nWith only a 12% gap remaining to reach 2018 levels, Sri Lanka appears positioned to achieve full tourism recovery, provided current positive trends continue and no major external disruptions occur.\n\nSri Lanka's journey to recover tourism to 2018 levels illustrates both the vulnerability of the tourism industry to external shocks and its remarkable capacity for resilience and strategic recovery. The data reveals an extraordinary story of decline and revival: from a peak of 2,333,796 visitors in 2018, through a devastating low of 194,495 in 2021 (representing a 91.7% decline), to near complete recovery with 2,053,465 visitors by 2024.\n\nThe 2025 partial year data marks a pivotal moment in this recovery narrative. With 1,566,523 visitors in the first nine months achieving just 32.8% growth over 2018 baseline levels, Sri Lanka appears poised to finally match or marginally exceed its pre crisis performance. This represents the successful completion of a seven year recovery journey that tested the industry's resilience through multiple crises.\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report August 2025\n\nFuture Trajectory\n\nHaving achieved the primary objective of matching 2018 levels, Sri Lanka's tourism industry now faces a new challenge: transitioning from recovery mode to sustainable growth mode. The 14.9% growth rate in 2025, while positive, suggests the need for strategic innovation to prevent stagnation and achieve new growth targets."

London (2.80%) remains the primary direct long haul link to Europe and a key entry point for the important UK market.\n\nThe data detailing the airlines used by tourists arriving in Sri Lanka in August 2025 reveals a highly competitive and strategically layered aviation market. The national carrier, Sri Lankan Airlines, asserts its dominant position as the clear market leader, transporting 48,890 passengers and capturing nearly a quarter of all tourist arrivals with a 24.66% share. This signifies its critical role in the country's tourism infrastructure. However, the overwhelming majority of the market, approximately 75%, is served by foreign airlines, highlighting both the intense competition and Sri Lanka's deep integration into global aviation networks.\n\nThe most powerful bloc of these foreign carriers hails from the Middle East, collectively forming the largest competitive force. Qatar Airways stands as the second largest individual airline with a 12.28% share, followed closely by Emirates at 9.36% and Etihad Airways at 7.65%.

Sri Lanka's tourism industry, while benefiting from its strong national carrier, is notably dependent on the capacity and routing strategies of foreign airlines, particularly the powerful Middle Eastern conglomerates. The extraordinary success of IndiGo points to a major opportunity for further deepening ties with the Indian travel market through low cost carriers.

Top ten markets vs. main last departure airports to Sri Lanka, August 2025\n\nThe travel patterns for the Indian market are the most straightforward and distinct. The vast majority of Indian tourists arrive on direct flights from their own major cities, with minimal reliance on international hubs. A staggering 15,230 departed from Chennai, followed by 7,366 from Bangalore, 6,211 from Mumbai, and 5,755 from Delhi. This overwhelming use of direct connections (Hyderabad also contributed 3,553) means that Middle Eastern hubs play an almost negligible role for Indian travelers, who clearly prioritize direct access.\n\nIn stark contrast, tourists from Europe are overwhelmingly funneled through Middle Eastern hubs. For travelers from the United Kingdom, Doha (5,197) and Dubai (3,322) are the top two departure points, significantly outweighing direct flights from London (4,645). This pattern is even more pronounced for German, Italian, French, and Spanish tourists. For instance, majorities from these nations transit through hubs like Doha, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi, with Istanbul also serving as a key gateway, particularly for Spanish (1,507) and Italian (1,159) visitors. This underscores the dominant role of airlines like Qatar Airways, Emirates, Etihad, and Turkish Airlines in connecting continental Europe to Sri Lanka.\n\n20\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report August 2025"

The data shows an overwhelming dependence on a single hub: Singapore. A massive (2,663) Australian tourists transited through Singapore, a number that dwarfs the second most popular option, the direct connection from Melbourne (2,151). This clearly establishes Singapore Airlines as the carrier of choice for Australian visitors, with very few opting for Middle Eastern or other transit points, illustrating a highly streamlined travel corridor between Australia and Sri Lanka via Singapore.\n\nTable 6.

For Japan, Sri Lankan Airlines (51.57%) is also the leading carrier, but a significant portion of traffic is distributed among East Asian carriers like China Eastern (10.10%), Air Asia (8.89%), and Singapore Airlines (5.89%), indicating the use of regional hubs like Shanghai and Singapore for connectivity.\n\nIn direct contrast, long haul markets from Europe are overwhelmingly dependent on the big three Middle Eastern carriers (Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad Airways) and Turkish Airlines. For instance, the United Kingdom spreads its traffic across Sri Lankan Airlines (31.27%), Qatar Airways (25.86%), and Emirates (17.75%). This pattern is even more pronounced for continental European nations. Germany\u2019s arrivals are heavily reliant on Qatar Airways (26.80%), Emirates (19.82%), and Etihad Airways (16.32%). France uses a similar mix, while Italy and Spain show a particularly strong preference for Etihad Airways (20.07% and 22.85% respectively) and Turkish Airlines (9.46% and 17.04%). The Netherlands presents the most extreme case of Middle Eastern hub dependency, with a massive 32.59% share for Qatar Airways and 26.77% for Emirates. The national carrier holds a much smaller share in these European markets, underscoring the competitive power of the Gulf hubs."

    "chunk_text": "In direct contrast, long haul markets from Europe are overwhelmingly dependent on the big three Middle Eastern carriers (Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad Airways) and Turkish Airlines. For instance, the United Kingdom spreads its traffic across Sri Lankan Airlines (31.27%), Qatar Airways (25.86%), and Emirates (17.75%). This pattern is even more pronounced for continental European nations. Germany\u2019s arrivals are heavily reliant on Qatar Airways (26.80%), Emirates (19.82%), and Etihad Airways (16.32%). France uses a similar mix, while Italy and Spain show a particularly strong preference for Etihad Airways (20.07% and 22.85% respectively) and Turkish Airlines (9.46% and 17.04%). The Netherlands presents the most extreme case of Middle Eastern hub dependency, with a massive 32.59% share for Qatar Airways and 26.77% for Emirates. The national carrier holds a much smaller share in these European markets, underscoring the competitive power of the Gulf hubs.\n\nIn conclusion, this data is vital for strategic planning. It shows Sri Lankan Airlines' solid position in the South Asian and East Asian markets but also its significant vulnerability to the competitive pricing and extensive networks of the Middle Eastern giants in its valuable European source markets. The overwhelming preference for specific airlines in each region provides a clear roadmap for targeted marketing campaigns and commercial partnerships, suggesting that tourism authorities should collaborate closely with Qatar Airways for the Dutch and German markets, with Etihad for Italian and Spanish tourists, and with Singapore Airlines for the Australian market to maximize arrival numbers.\n\n22\n\nMonthly Tourist Arrivals Report August 2025\n\nSri Lanka Tourism Development Authority\n\nResearch & International Relations Division\n\n011 2426800 Ext. 151/155\n\nresearch@srilanka.travel\n\nwww.sltda.gov.lk"
